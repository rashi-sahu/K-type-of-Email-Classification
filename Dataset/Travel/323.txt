Welcome
Hello and welcome to my website. This site has been in existence in one form or another since 1997 and originally aimed to look at the world of the Projectionist, the Projector and the cinema industry as a whole. Over the years it has grown and expanded but its aim is to provide information about this part of the entertainment industry.
Today as technology and cinema has changed there is additional information on other areas of projection, whether it is in a non-traditional local venue, projection mapping, 360 degree or any other environment where a projected image is used to tell a story.
The site continues to aim to look at everything from the earliest cinema technology through to whatever the future has to hold, and everything in between. By far the largest part of this site is now as a news resource providing curated information on the technical and business side of cinema, but also with longer ‘blog’ articles – if you want to see what the latest article I have written is, then head over to the blog contents page.
For a long introduction to the website, then read the introduction section.
