Welcome to Rheidol Riding Centre!
We are a family run British Horse Society Approved Riding, Training and Examination Centre.
We purchased Felinrhiwarthen a small run down farm in 1991 and have converted it in to a thriving equestrian business.
The Centre has full-size floodlit indoor and full-size floodlit outdoor riding arenas, a showjumping and cross-country course, and fantastic trekking and hacking around the Rheidol Valley.
We are situated in the middle of the picturesque Rheidol Valley,4 miles from the town of Aberystwyth.
The Centre is enclosed by the River Rheidol to one side and the Vale of Rheidol Railway on the other – a narrow-gauge steam train running along the valley to take tourists up to the famous Victorian Devil’s Bridge Falls.
