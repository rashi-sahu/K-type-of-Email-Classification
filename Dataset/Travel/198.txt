Four
thousand images...
The Todmorden Album collection in its entirety contains some 4,000 images
dating back to the 1860s, with many from the early twentieth century.
The photographs provide a rich pictorial history of the growth and development
of Todmorden, its people and industries, buildings and communities, transport
and commerce. The
collection continues to grow due to generous donations and loans from
local families and organisations who have allowed their photographs to
be copied.
