Welcome
Welcome to the Camborne Old Cornwall Society website
Founded in 1923, we are a society dedicated to preserving the history, heritage and culture of the parish of Camborne and surrounding area in Cornwall, justly renowned as one of the great mining centres of the world. This website is not only a valuable source of information for our visitors, but it also keeps our members informed about forthcoming talks and guided walks, all of which are open to the general public. We hope you enjoy your visit and that maybe you will consider joining one of the oldest surviving organisations in Cornwall. Archives of this and the former COCS website can be found at the UK Web Archiving Consortium.
