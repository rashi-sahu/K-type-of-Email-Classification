Welcome to
Malcolm Bull's Calderdale Companion
In my Calderdale Companion, you'll find
a collection of Trivia, Miscellaneous Facts, and some interesting
information about Halifax and the Calderdale district of West
Yorkshire, England
The website began as a medium for me to record notes which I made
whilst reading local history and family history sources, notes which
I thought that others may find interesting.
It is not intended to be a serious research tool; indeed, I do not do
any specific research for the website, and any one person or entity
is no more important to me than any other.
Please, please, note that there really is no point in emailing to ask
me for further information or photographs relating to any
topic ... what you see here is all that I
know!
Indeed, if I did know any more, why would I not include it here?
And, if I did know any more but do not include it here, why would I
tell you?
I now receive so many emails from people asking for more
information – usually without offering any
information in return – that I can no longer afford to
waste valuable time in acknowledging them.
In future, any such emails will be ignored without response.
Because of ownership issues, the extra work involved, and the
constant assumption that all photos are available in a larger format
and in a higher resolution, I can no longer supply copies of any of
the photos which are used on
the Calderdale Companion,
whether for private use or for publication.
I do not record sources for the information – because this was taking
up too much disk space – and the website is not intended to be a
serious research tool, nor a short-cut for the lazy researcher.
Indeed, it would be foolish to take information from this or any
other website without doing your own research to verify all your
information.
Please note also that I cannot respond to specific genealogical
enquiries – I am not a free research tool! nor am I here to teach you
how to carry out your research!
This may sound harsh, but the website is free ... and remember the
saying about looking a gift horse in the mouth!
The Calderdale Companion is aimed at:
Anyone with an interest in the local history of the Halifax and
Calderdale district of West Yorkshire, no matter whether as an active
pursuit or as an armchair enthusiasm
Tourists who are visiting or intend to visit the beautiful Calderdale
district – you might be interested in our entries on Calderdale
for Motorists, and Things to see in Calderdale
Anyone with recent or distant roots and links with this part of the
world – for this group of readers, I have included a number of
historical entries and information which might otherwise be
inaccessible to overseas visitors
Anyone who already lives in Halifax and Calderdale and wants to know
just that bit more about what's all around them
Anyone who is tracing their family tree and needs some
explanation of the terms and the terminology which they encounter in
old documents
Anyone who is fascinated by local and historical trivia
Anyone who wants an explanation of the terms which are likely to be
encountered when reading the works of the Brontës, Anne Lister's
journals, or other pre-20th century works
Anyone who knows anything – about Halifax, Calderdale,
the people or the places – which seems interesting to them and which
is hard to find.
I am particularly aware that many older people have memories and
stories which should be recorded ... before it's too late
Anyone who just wants to settle – or start – an argument in the pub
