Text Size
If the text size on this web
site, apart from this paragraph, seems a little small (or
large), this could be because your browser has “been
adjusted” by another web site.
In Internet Explorer, go to the View menu and
the Text Size option to adjust it. Other browsers will be
similar, but probably not affected in the same way.
Why are other web sites not affected? Because
they don't allow you to change the text size!
