Old Ferry Inn, Bodinnick, Fowey
Situated on the banks of the Fowey River Estuary in the village of Bodinnick, The Old Ferry is a quintessential Cornish Inn that has been providing accommodation and refreshment for over 400 years. We overlook the Bodinnick to Fowey ferry which can trace its roots back to the 13th Century, and 'Ferryside' the former family home of Daphne du Maurier.
The Inn with its relaxed and warm welcome has many traditional features including a wood burner and stone slate floor, and is full of old photographs, nautical bric-a-brac and memorabilia. The perfect place to while away time during the winter months.
You can also dine in our River Room, which has fantastic river views towards the town of Fowey and the village of Polruan. There are also south facing outside terraces which also have splendid estuary views, and capture the sun all day, a perfect retreat for a summers day.
After a day spent along the Hall Walk, or the South West Coastal Footpath, or exploring the many delights our local area Lanteglos-by-Fowey and Cornwall has to offer, what could be better than coming back to a meal lovingly prepared by our chefs, all from locally sourced produce.
We serve food all day, and have 12 bedrooms, most of which have river views and en-suites, and our rates include Full English cooked breakfast.
We have our own free car park available, located approximately 20 meters away from the Inn - see Getting Here for details.
Free Wi-fi is available in our bar and lounge area.
We welcome everyone to come and join us including your dog!

Just back after a Fantastic weeks stay at The Old Ferry Inn. Like to thank Pascal and his Staff for their attention and service. Wonderful room with views overlooking the estuary to Fowey and Polruan. Good choise for Breakfast which set us up for the day. The evening meal also was excellent with a good selection of sea food. Look forward to staying there again .
