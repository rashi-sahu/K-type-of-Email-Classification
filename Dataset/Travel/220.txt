Thanks to active member Phil, we have a Flickr group which is populated with loads of fantastic pictures of the insect and bird life that eager photographers have catalogued on their visits to the site, including Firecrests and Lesser redpoll. It’s setup as an open group so you can contribute your own pictures and videos to share with everybody. Please do! You’ll find a permanent link in the sidebar to the right.

It has been mentioned that this page is a bit out of sync with the seasons, and so here’s a view shot in September, but this was September 1992 – our formal open day. Star guest David Bellamy has his back to the camera though …..
but just to show that things have been happening, our resident pair of woodpecker busy earlier this year …

Springtime is coming!
With an obvious eye for a view, Soonu Dilke sent us this photo of the Mere (with the willow basket sculpture on the opposite bank) taken on a sunny afternoon in March…
Many thanks Soonu, we look forward to more of your photos in the future.

It’s that time of year.
A heron on sentry duty in the willow tree, looking for a snack in or on the water below. Duckling and fish as likely targets.
….and a fox lurking in the undergrowth, probably heading for nearby back gardens

The flooding of a year ago is practically forgotten.
A clear, cold and still morning on site to do a bit of general tidying and a few sightings in the process, all seen on the mere within 15 minutes or so;
………… a kingfisher enjoying the sunshine
a tufted duck …….
the ubiquitous mallard showing his colours …….
……………………..  and is that a little grebe? ….
Spring is almost sprung!
