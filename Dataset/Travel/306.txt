Meet Us - BEFORE WE -Meet You
Nestled on the outskirts of Britain’s second city sits a manor house. Inside is a hub of young creatives, bringing the old estate back to life. Sommeliers and barristas, chefs and artists invite you into their playhouse to explore.
Food and drink is at the centre of what we do, with Michelin Star, four AA Rosette, Peel’s restaurant running as the living heart of the building. We take you off the beaten track with our seasonal, hand crafted, and local products and produce. Experience single-batch teas from artisan growers, biodynamic wines and ingredients foraged from our very own kitchen garden.
Hampton Manor was built as a home for the Peel family, and today its new family owners have created a home away from home for your guests, offering you a welcome that was awarded Michelin’s Welcome and Service Award for 2017. Original Minton tiles, hand painted stained glass, and carved oak banisters sit beside marble topped tables and chinoiserie wallpaper. Stay in one of our 15 bespoke bedrooms to step away from city life and chip out in the country.

Food for Thought: New Beginnings
It’s a new year and we are all just returning to work and school in my household.
Day one generally goes something like this: the night before, bags are packed for all three of my sons, lunches are prepared ahead and in the fridge. Uniforms are laid out and sports kits are ready to go. My work clothes are ironed, bag ready, laptop charges… and so on. We get up, at the first alarm, and all eat breakfast together in a civilised manner, having already walked the dog. We have time for a hug before the eldest goes to catch ...
