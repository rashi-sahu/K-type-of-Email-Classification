Tollgate Farm Caravan and Camping Park, perranporth, Cornwall. Close to beaches.
2017 tariffs and dates are now available just head to the booking section for details.
Tollgate Farm Caravan & Camping Site is a quiet, family run site set in acres of tranquil countryside, ideally located for all of Cornwall, with easy access to both north and south coasts, the Lizard Peninsula, Land's End, and all the attractions Cornwall has to offer.
The site offers generous pitches situated within four enclosed areas , offering panoramic coastal views. As we are less than 1 mile to Perranporth's shops and beach, it is only a short drive. There are also three walks to the beach, the quickest being 15 - 20 minutes, with spectacular views. The easiest of which can be undertaken with pushchairs and young children, ranging to the coastal path for those who enjoy more of a challenge. Two of these walks end in Perranporth town.
Ideally located for walking, Tollgate Farm neighbours sand dunes that lead to the beautiful 3 mile beach at Perran Bay where, if you love live music and good food, you'll find The Watering Hole right on the beach.
We are a family and couples ONLY site and therefore will not admit groups.
PLEASE NOTE: If you book individually but then meet up as a group on site you will ALL be asked to leave with no refunds given.
We welcome dogs and other pets, as long as they are well behaved.
