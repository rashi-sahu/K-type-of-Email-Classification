The Bude Art Society, founded in 1963, now has about forty members, drawn mainly from Bude and its hinterlands in Devon and Cornwall.
Members meet regularly to share ideas and expertise, and to encourage each other in the practice of art.
For most of the year we meet each Thursday at the Parkhouse Centre in Bude, with monthly tutored workshops, half or full day, led by West Country artists of repute.
During the months of July and August, we paint 'al fresco' (weather permitting!) at local sites of interest.
We hold one large exhibition each summer, when any member who chooses may show their work - no selection committee!
We make visitors very welcome at all times, so please do come and join us, either as a visitor or member. Absolute beginners and all abilities are most welcome - the only criterion is an interest in the practice of art.
Membership of Bude Art Society costs Â£16.00 per year.
