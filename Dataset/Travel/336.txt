Oliver's
Cornwall
A
Visitors Guide to the very best of Cornwall
chosen
by Oliver Howes, retired driver/guide
This
web site contains a  brief introductory guide, hundreds of honest
reviews of homes, gardens, castles, churches, museums, antiquities, towns,
villages, coast and country walks - and well over a thousand photographs.
Composed in old-fashioned Netscape Composer 4.79, the site is primitive
and will look best if your screen width aligns text with images.
Use the site contents below to discover Oliver's Cornwall.  If you
have any views on my site, whether favourable or critical, or if you spot
any obvious howlers, please use the 'Contact Me' button.
Oliver's Cornwall has recently
undergone major changes.  Increasingly, my visitors are looking for
walks.  So I have created Oliver's Cornwall Walking Pages, with pages
for the Coast Path, Coastal Round Walks, Inland Trails, Coast-to-Coast
Trails and Country and Moorland Walking.  More information on my What's
New page.
Text and images should align.
To view this page at its best, adjust your zoom so that the page uses full
