Cornwall Ceramics and Glass Groupâ€¦promoting Cornish pottery, potters and glass makers
Cornwall Ceramics and Glass Group are individual makers
within the contemporary Cornish art scene. We came together
in 2004 with the aim of promoting and encouraging all those
passionate about and working in ceramics, glass or sculpture.
Our busy programme of events, including masterclasses, studio visits and workshop demonstrations, run throughout the year, helping the creative juices flow for all with an enthusiasm for clay and glass.
