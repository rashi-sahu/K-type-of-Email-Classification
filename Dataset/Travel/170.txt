Race to the Top
How are supermarkets performing in their promotion of a greener
and fairer food system? Are they sourcing food from wherever it can
be produced at lowest cost with the lowest ethical, environmental,
animal welfare and labour standards? Or are they competing on social,
environmental and ethical performance - a 'race to the top'?
These questions are at the heart
of the Race to the Top project, coordinated
by the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED).
Final Report now available
The Race to the Top project
ended prematurely following a confidential pilot year (2002) in which
six supermarkets took part and one publicly reported year (2003),
in which only three supermarkets participated. A full report on the
lessons learned from the project is now available.
The materials,
methodologies and research developed throughout the course of the
project will remain accessible and we encourage other initiatives
to make use of them. On behalf of the project partners, IIED is grateful
to the many people who have expressed interest in and support for
the project.
