Milton Keynes Heritage Association - MKHA - formed in 1994 by a number of local heritage groups and museums, with the
aim of encouraging and developing co-operation between organisations having an interest in heritage in Milton Keynes,
North Buckinghamshire and South Northamptonshire. It also has a central role in promoting heritage, by working closely
with Councils and other agencies.
MKHA has around 60 member organisations, with a broad range of interests and a wide geographical coverage from
Buckingham in the west, Olney in the east, Towcester in the north and Woburn Sands in the south.
