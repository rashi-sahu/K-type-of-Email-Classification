With over 18,000 pages of
free walking information, "Walking Britain" is dedicated to the footpaths that cross the landscape. The National Parks feature strongly in the lists of walks including the Lake District, the Peak District and Snowdonia, not to mention the Yorkshire Dales. Although the natural world is the theme, man-made elements such as villages, bridges, mines and churches are also included in the many walking routes.
Submit your Walks
Many of the walks on this website have been submitted by other authors keen to spread the word about their favourite routes. You can do the same - just click HERE.
Plot your walks for free on an Ordnance Survey background map with the Hikideas
walk planner. You can then download them in pdf format and print them out.
Another "New Look" for Walking Britain!
The site was completely redesigned in
May 2014. However the rise in popularity of mobile and tablet platforms means a fresh approach is required and this responsive web site is the result, with completion at the end of July 2015. The reconstruction is almost complete and a new search facility will soon be added. Please report any issues you might encounter so I can make sure all users are happy with the new site.
