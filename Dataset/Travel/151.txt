Discover the beautiful
New Forest National Park
Welcome to my New Forest National Park
website, and to this unique part of the UK!
The National Park lies within the county of Hampshire, on the
south-central coast of England, and is predominantly occupied by an
area formerly just called the New Forest,
approximately 150 square miles in size and once a royal hunting ground
for King William I and his noblemen, in the 12th century AD.
The rare blend of open heathlands and ancient woodlands makes the New
Forest - affectionately called the Forest by
locals - a unique and very special place indeed, the underlying
features of which have changed little over the centuries.
The National Park status (given March 2005)
was awarded to the New Forest and immediate surrounding area in
recognition of the many qualities that the Forest holds. Although
received with mixed feelings, the new status will ensure the exciting
and secure future that the area deserves.
This website has been created by someone
local to the New Forest, to help share the atmosphere of this very
unique part of southern England.
