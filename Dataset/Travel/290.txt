THE SOCIAL GROUP ~ A NAME YOU CAN RELY ON
We pass an annual bank compliance test, have our accounts done properly by a top local firm, pay our taxes on time, and follow all government guidelines, with Trading Standards officers having offered us lots of good advice to help us make sure everything is done properly.
Established and successful since the 1990s, you know you’ll be safe in our hands and able to relax and enjoy yourself!
Good times, good fun, and good company!
THE SOCIAL NETWORK
We had the original idea for some sort of ‘socialising connecting friendship mechanism’ in 1995.
The Social Group started in 1997, first operating as an organised “group of friends”.
In 2003 we founded Social Group Enterprises Ltd. to run the organisation on a professional basis, with full-time staff to look after you and work on organising a great social life for you!
We now offer a fabulous programme of social events and you can enjoy a social life fit for a celebrity, at a fraction of the cost!
ANDREW & CATHY’S SOCIAL GROUP
Our professional team of organisers is headed by husband and wife Andrew & Cathy who themselves met through The Social Group back in 1999 and got married in the middle of a Social Group Holiday to Las Vegas & USA National Parks in 2002.
The two of us believe in a personal and professional approach, and have developed a very hands-on style of social networking.
You’ll find we are on hand to host many of the dining out events, take part in most of the party nights, join in with many of the days out, are there on the ground to start off lots of the activities, and even go on the group holidays which are organised for members!
By making ourselves the focus of The Social Group, with one male and one female perspective, it’s our hope you’ll feel this makes things more approachable and easy to feel you have two friends to start with.
You can speak to us in person on the phone, you can text us once you are a member, you can follow us on Twitter, and you can see our photos online and in Social Group Magazine.

LOOKING FOR ROMANCE?
We are primarily a socialising organisation / group of friends.
We are not a dating agency, believing we offer something better, which provides a more natural manner in which to make friends and meet someone special.
Little wonder we have been invited to so many weddings!
