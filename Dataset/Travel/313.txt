Welcome to KEAP
Kernow Education Arts Partnership (KEAP) is a leader in arts-led education in Cornwall.
Our organisation is a catalyst for cultural learning programmes which support and enhance curriculum activity through the creative arts. We understand the benefits of creative learning and as a team, we are passionate about making it happen.
KEAP has a long history of working in partnership with cultural organisations, schools and other education providers to enrich the arts curriculum.  Our work enables schools to extend their cultural offer through unique arts projects that inspire and excite children and teachers and provide an ongoing legacy of enthusiasm, new skills and increased confidence.
We work with clusters of schools and on county wide projects to give children the best access to the arts.  We regularly consult with teachers and arts education professionals and through our detailed knowledge of the sector we develop creative packages, programmes and partnerships.
Our flagship programme, The Story Republic, is a travelling world of words which celebrates the place of story in Cornwall’s culture. The schools’ element supports young people’s literacy and creative writing. and our installations and Story Republicans bring the wonder of the written word to life.
Have a look at our projects and see what we’re up to and do get in contact if you’re interested in working with us.
