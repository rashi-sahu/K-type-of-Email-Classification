Top Secret Cornwall
Porth Joke Beach
A small attractive cove, also known as Polly Joke that is north-west facing and less busy than other beaches nearby, with caves and rockpools to explore.
Porthtowan Tidal Pool, St Agnes
Wonderful, secluded tidal pool set among the cliffs, 300m to the north east of the main beach. At low tide you can walk along the sands to Chapel Porth.
Bosahan Cove & Frenchman’s Creek, Helford
Amongst the many several hidden coves with silver-shale beaches on the Helford Estuary, Bosahan Cove is our favourite. Backed by pretty woods this secluded cove is an easy destination on a kayak and just a mile east of Helford Village on the coast path.
Lantic Bay near Fowey
If you’re up for a bit of a hike then Lantic Bay will reward you with one of the most stunning locations in Cornwall without a doubt.
Cornwall for kids
Rock pooling at Towan Beach, Portscatho
As the tide ebbs away at Towan beach in Portscatho a world of rock pools is revealed, so get your fishing nets at the ready to explore what lurks beneath.
Heartlands
The adventure playground is arguably one of the best in the south west – think tunnels, slides, climbing frames and even a shipwrecked boat.
Tehidy Woods Country Park
Feed the ducks, spot birds and squirrels, climb trees and play Tarzan on rope swings. With over 9 miles of walking trails, Tehidy is the perfect location for adventurous families with buggy-bound tots (and little ones on bikes).
East Looe beach, Looe
A lovely bucket and spade style beach located on south east Cornwall’s tranquil coast.
