The
RAINYDAY GALLERY was first opened by Martin Val Baker at Cross
Street
Penzance, Cornwall in 1992 - and since then he has staged
over 200
Solo and Mixed Exhibitions. From 1998 the Gallery operated at the
lower
end of Market Jew Street until moving, in 2002 to first floor
premises at the top of the street, opposite the statue of Humphry
Davy.On July 7th 2007 the Gallery moved again this time to ground
floor premises half way down Market Jew Street on the towns historic
Terrace next door to 'Restless Native' and almost opposite W
H Smiths.
In
January 2011 after eighteen years and 211 shows the Gallery finally
closed after attempting to survive the present
recession.............
