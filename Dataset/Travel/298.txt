Food From Cornwall ~ Your Comprehensive Guide to Cornish Food & Drink
Whether you are a local looking to find something new, a tourist planning a holiday, a restaurateur seeking inspiring ingredients, or you just want to recall the Cornish experience you’ve come to the right place.
Over 330 Cornish food and drink producers’ details are listed here. Click on the menu bar above to source anything from fresh fish to pasties, traditional mead to saffron cake, clotted cream to succulent prime beef . Most of these products will be obtainable in local retail outlets, but some will only be available from the farm where they’re grown. In addition there is a wealth of news, recipes and information about farmers’ markets, farm shops and food events.
So do explore – it’s what Cornwall is all about.
Bakery & Sweets
Cornwall produces exceptional artisan breads, classic scones and splits for Cornish cream teas and, of course, the world famous Cornish Pasty that has been given its own Protected Status.
Beverages
Renowned the world over for its beers, ciders and wines: from St Austell ales to Rattler cider to the international award winning Camel Valley vinery.
Dairy & Eggs
The Cornish dairy farms produce high quality milk, clotted cream and dozens of amazing cheeses including world champion Cornish Blue, Davidstow cheddar and the unique nettle wrapped Cornish Yarg.
Fish
Cornwall is surrounded by some of the richest and most beautiful coastal waters in the UK and this is reflected in the wonderful range and quality of its fresh fish and shellfish.
Fruit & Vege
Rich soils and a warm maritime climate have given Cornwall a varied and bountiful range of local fruit and vegetables, many of which are sought after “earlies”.
Meat
The lush grasses of the Cornish landscape enable livestock to deliver meat with a succulent taste that is very distinctive to Cornwall whether it be a rib-eye steak or a bursting banger on the barbeque.
Miscellaneous
Cornwall produces and makes so many items that they can't all be neatly categorised, so we've made them a special category all of their own - here!
Preserves & Spices
With varied and lush countryside Cornwall provides some of the most beautiful raw ingredients to create jams, chutneys, honey and spices.
