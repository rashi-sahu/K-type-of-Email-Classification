Welcome
Pendarves Street, Tuckingmill, Camborne, c.1910
Welcome to Postcards of Cornwall. This site features many hundreds of images of postcards, mainly from the first few decades of the 20th century, from all over Cornwall. The site already contains more than 500 postcards of Cornwall, from the Isles of Scilly in the south west to Morwenstow in the north east, and many hundreds more will be added as and when time allows.
This site is basically an updated version of the postcard pages from the now defunct A Cornish Sourcebook which closed in October 2009. All of the postcards featured on A Cornish Sourcebook have now been moved to this new site. News of upcoming postcard fairs in Cornwall can now be found on the Diary page.
Of course, many visitors will be happy to browse, but if you are looking for postcards of any specific place then there are several different ways of searching. If you know which hundred and parish your preferred town or village is in, then you can go straight to the sections listed on the side menu. If you don't know which hundred your preferred location is in then you can look at either the Site Map or the List all Pages indexes. If you are looking for postcards of a particular subject, such as chapels or mining, then the Tag Cloud will bring up a list of all tags attached to each page. Clicking on the tags will bring up a list of all pages featuring that tag. This can also be useful when searching for a particular town or village. The search box at the top right of each page will bring up all pages featuring your search; so, for example, a search for Redruth will bring up not only postcards of Redruth, but all other pages featuring postcards published in Redruth.
There is also a Gallery on the top menu. This features thumbnails of every single postcard on the site; useful for browsing. The postcards are shown in alphabetical order. Finally, the Recent Changes page will show which pages on the site have most recently been updated, and when.
Please note that this website is copyright of Chris Bond. If you wish to include any of these images on your own site then please contact me and as long as a link to this site is included alongside any images used then I will probably be happy to oblige, although I cannot give permission to use images from cards owned by others. The description for each card on this site will always state if the card is from someone else's collection. Publishers and broadcasters are welcome to contact me with regard to the provision, where possible, of high resolution images, though as I do sell postcards on it may not always be possible to access the original.
