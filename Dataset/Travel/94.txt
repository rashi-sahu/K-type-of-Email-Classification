The Harlequin Ladybird has landed!
A new ladybird has arrived in Britain.
But not just any ladybird: this is the harlequin ladybird, Harmonia axyridis,
the most invasive ladybird on Earth.
The harlequin ladybird was introduced to North America in 1988, where it is now
the most widespread ladybird species on the continent. It has already invaded much
of northwestern Europe, and arrived in Britain in summer 2004.
The distribution map on the left or the
annnual spread maps
show that it has spread rapidly north and west from the southeast of England since
its first sighting.
There are 46 species of ladybird (Coccinellidae) resident in Britain and the recent
arrival of the harlequin ladybird has the potential to jeopardise many of these.
The Harlequin Ladybird Survey will monitor its spread across Britain
and assess its impact on native ladybirds.
Monitoring ladybirds across the country has never been more important.
