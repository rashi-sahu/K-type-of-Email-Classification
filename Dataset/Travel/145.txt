Natural History of Teesside
Welcome to
Dave Barlow's Natural History site
Natural History around Teesside
Teesside, although a fairly small geographical area is
very diverse in the number of wildlife habitats that it encompasses.
The north sea is probably the biggest influence in what can be seen
in the area. A much fuller account of the habitats in the area can
be read in the
excellent new book on the breeding birds of the Cleveland area.
If you are remotely interested in natural history you
may like to take look at my natural history links and some of the birding
and botanical habitats in and around the Teesside area. You may also
like to take a look at the excellent web site of the Teesmouth Bird Club
Fox on the bird feeding station at Saltholme
My interests range over a number of aspects of natural history. Birdwatching
has been a lifelong passion with developing interests in botany and
entomology. If you are keen in any aspect of natural history
there are a number of clubs in the region to meet others with similar
interests, see the natural history links section.
