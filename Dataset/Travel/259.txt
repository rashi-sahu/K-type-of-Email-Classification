"We believe that the four nations of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales
are stronger united than apart. The Union has brought stability,
peace and
prosperity to the United Kingdom.  Yet today, the Union is under threat.
Power has been devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in an ad hoc,
piecemeal fashion. Successive Governments have taken the Union for
granted.
Proper consideration of the cumulative impact of devolution
on the integrity of the Union itself has been lacking . . ." more

Johnson seeks devolved powers for London
Daily Telegraph
"Boris Johnson is seeking a new devolution deal for London to give it greater powers
over skills, criminal justice, transport and housing.  The Mayor of London, whose
tenure ends in less than a year, has reportedly met Greg Clark, the
Communities
Secretary, to discuss new powers.  He has united
with
London Councils,the umbrella group for the city's
boroughs, to make a list of demands.
It comes as ministers move to delegate new powers to several cities.
Jules Pipe, the mayor of Hackney who chairs London Councils said
there was "a real risk of London falling behind even Cornwall"
in its level of influence over areas such as skills."
