Vanity Fair filming begins in Bath
The film is set to be released in autumn 2004
Hollywood has arrived in Somerset as filming begins in Bath for a production of Vanity Fair.
The adaptation of William Thackeray's novel
features an all-star cast including Reese Witherspoon, Jim Broadbent and Bob Hoskins.
Parts of the city centre have been given a makeover to take them back 200 years, and some streets are being closed for the duration.
Set in the early 19th Century, the film is a
period drama directed by Mira Nair, known for Monsoon Wedding, with a screenplay by Gosford Park writer, Julian Fellowes.
'Rare scale'
Councillor Roger Symonds told the BBC: "This film will be shown to millions of people across the world: they will know it is Bath and will want to come here."
Maggie Ainley, from the Bath Film Office, added: "We deal with about 100 productions a year in the city - but it is rare to get something of this scale."
Filming is concentrated on Great Pultney Street, and is due to end in the city on Friday.
The film is expected to be released in autumn 2004.
