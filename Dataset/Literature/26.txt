Edward Lear in the TLS
Posted on February 16, 2017 by Marco Graziosi
The Times Literary Supplement for 3 February has not one, not two, but three articles on Edward Lear:
Adam Kendon’s “Edward Lear Painting Parrots” is a review of Robert McCracken Peck’s recent The Natural History of Edward Lear;
Ben Westwood’s “Lear and the Fool” reviews Edward Lear and the Play of Poetry, and
Barbara Everett’s “Better than Great: Good” is the text of a December 2016 “address given at the Institute of Advanced Study, University of London, at an event to mark the publication of Edward Lear and the Play of Poetry.”
This last concludes:
Edward Lear is surely better than great: he is good. He makes a brilliance or a radiance out of those who inhabit a kind of nonsensical underside of society, the defeated from birth, still capable of flight…, the lonely who can write, all the loving-unloved, the cats with half a tail.
Unfortunately all these essays are available only to subscribers.

Edward Lear Letters under the Hammer
Posted on February 15, 2017 by Marco Graziosi
Several letters by Edward Lear were auctioned last September at Forum Auctions. I would be interested in knowing where they ended up, especially the two containing nonsense and pictures.
One from 1848 to Charles Church on their travels in Greece and Albania:

Edward Lear, Nave of Arundel Church
Posted on January 2, 2017 by Marco Graziosi
“Nave of Arundel Church,” from M.A. Tierney, The History and Antiquities of the Castle and Town of Arundel: Including the Biography of Its Earls, from the Conquest to the Present Time. London: G. And W. Nicol, 1834. Volume 2, facing p. 743.
This is perhaps Edward Lear’s first published non-zoological illustration; he must have made it during one of his frequent visits to Arundel, where his sister Sarah had married and where he met some of his first supporters.

Edward Lear, Cannes and the Esterel Mountains (1865)
Posted on December 26, 2016 by Marco Graziosi
Edward Lear, Cannes and the Esterel Mountains, France.
Watercolor with pen and brown ink over traces of pencil; inscribed lower left: Cannes. 8 April 8am 1865, extensively inscribed with color notes. 355 by 555 mm; 13 7/8  by 21 7/8  in.
Lear drew this large-scale and very fine view of Cannes on the morning of 8 April 1865, towards the end of an extended stay in the south of France. He was primarily there to build a body of work for an exhibition that he intended to hold in London later in the year. He based himself at Nice and from there he visited the local towns along the coast. Lear must have found Cannes particularly inspirational for alongside drawing the port and its environs, he also penned his nonsense poems The History of the Seven Families of the Lake of Pipple-Popple.1
1. V. Noakes, Edward Lear 1812-1888, London 1985, p. 172
Provenance:
A. Davidson;
with Agnew’s, London, by 1973;
J.J. Carteer, Paris
Sotheby’s.

Edward Lear, The Plains of Bethany
Posted on December 22, 2016 by Marco Graziosi
Edward Lear, The Plains of Bethany.
Signed with monogram (lower left). Oil on canvas. 9 ½ x 18 3/8 in. (24.1 x 47.6 cm.)
Jerusalem, with its powerful biblical associations, was the goal of many artist-travellers to the Near East in the 19th Century. Edward Lear, aware of the particular veneration in which the city was held, wrote as early as 1848 of his desire to visit the Holy Land: ‘How I wish someone would pay my way to Palestine; I should like to see Jerusalem of all things’. After two earlier attempts had failed, his journey was eventually enabled by a commission from Lady Waldegrave, one of the most loyal of his patrons. He reached Jerusalem on 27 March 1858, and the next day, Palm Sunday, explored the country immediately outside the walls. The city was crowded with Easter pilgrims however, and he decided to continue his journey south to Petra.
The little village of Bethany lay on the eastern slopes of the Mount of Olives, reputedly the Biblical site of the Tomb of Lazarus, and is now the village of Al-Azariyeh. Lear wrote to Lady Waldegrave about his travels out of Jerusalem: ‘Every path leads you to a fresh thought: – this takes you to Bethany, lovely now as it ever must have been: quiet, still little nook of valley scenery. There is Rephaïm & you see the Philistines crowding over the great plain – Down that ravine you go to Jericho: from that point you see the Jordan and Gilead…I cannot conceive any place on Earth like Jerusalem for astonishing and yet unfailing mines of interest’ (27 May 1858, cited in Lady Strachey, Letters of Edward Lear, London, 1907, p. 107).
This painting, believed to have been executed in 1879, is based on a watercolour sold in these Rooms on 17 November 1992 (lot 104), which is inscribed ‘Bethany/Edward Lear: del. 1858.’ and is dedicated to ‘Miss Baring. Stratton Hall. Mitcheldever. Hants.’ It had passed down by descent to Thomas George Baring, 1st Earl of Northbrook. A larger version of the drawing, without the figures (12¾ x 20in. and inscribed ‘Bethany 25 of April./1858’), was sold in these Rooms on 10 July 1984 (lot 280) as having been in the collection of Franklin Lushington.
The painting is known to have been in the collection of James Parker who, for nearly fifty years, was Curator of European Sculpture and Decorative Arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, having previously worked at the Louvre, Paris, and the Victoria & Albert Museum, London. He bequeathed it to Marvin Schwartz, Curator of Decorative Arts at the Brooklyn Museum, later consultant tat the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, who originated the weekly ‘Antiques’ column in The New York Times.
We are grateful to Briony Llewellyn for her help in preparing this catalogue entry.
