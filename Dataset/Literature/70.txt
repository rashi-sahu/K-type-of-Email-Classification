“
The web, then, or the pattern, a web at once sensuous and logical, an elegant and pregnant texture: that is style, that is the foundation of the art of literature
”

Welcome to the RLS Website
The most comprehensive web resource dedicated to Robert Louis Stevenson, designed for all: academics, school children and everybody interested in learning about RLS.
This is the place for information on Stevenson’s life and works – and much more. RLS is not just the author of Treasure Island and Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Search the site, and you’ll find he’s also a poet, a playwright, a Gothicist, a historian, an anthropologist, a Victorian, and a Postmodernist. In short, an outstanding modern writer, constantly experimenting.
The RLS Site supports the new Stevenson edition, EdRLS. For latest news and more, visit the EdRLS Blog.
Get involved with the RLS Writing Competition and find out more about RLS Day.
