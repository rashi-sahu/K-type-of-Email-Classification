Constitution
Welcome to the Website of the Jane Austen Society
The Society's main aim is to foster the appreciation and study of the work, life and times of Jane Austen, and the Austen family.
Society Events
Members gain priority access to Society events, which include our London Study Day, held in the first quarter of the year, the AGM with guest speaker
in Chawton in July, and our 3-day Annual Conference held in September. The Conference venue changes every year, and during this 200th anniversary period
we are visiting the areas related to each of the novels.
Society Newsletters
Members also receive two Newsletters per year and our prestigious Annual Report, a scholarly publication which includes articles on recent research and
discoveries, acquisitions at the Museum, a bibliography of new books and articles, information from sale-rooms, and some illustrations.
Branches and Groups
In addition to the Society's day and weekend conferences, a varied menu of events is offered by Branches
and Groups in Bath and Bristol, Cambridge, Hampshire, Kent, London, the Midlands, the North, Scotland, South West, and counties
adjoining Surrey - the Southern Circle. The active participation of new members is encouraged by the organisers.
Other Information
The Society is happy to be contacted on matters concerning Jane Austen, and to answer queries about her life and work. Please contact the Honorary Secretary
