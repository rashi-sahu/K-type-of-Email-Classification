The painting is similar to a pastel portrait owned by a collector
The sale of a painting believed to show the Bronte sisters has been halted following information that could prove it depicts the literary trio. The portrait of three women was due to be auctioned in Northamptonshire this week.
But it was withdrawn from sale after a collector came forward about a similar Bronte portrait by the same artist. The auctioneer said this could prove there was a link between the sisters and the artist, Sir Edwin Landseer.Auctioneer Jonathan Humbert said: "In light of the new information and its potential significance, we have postponed the sale and will evaluate the strength and implications of what has now come to light.
"This could help prove beyond doubt, the important link between Landseer, one of the 19th century's greatest artists, and the Bronte sisters, English literature's most perennial siblings."He added: "We can only do our best to prove beyond doubt, and obviously the more information we have the better our conclusion can be."The Bronte family moved to Haworth, West Yorkshire, in 1820 where the Reverend Patrick Bronte was appointed Curate of Haworth. They lived at the Haworth Parsonage from 1820 to 1861, which is now the Bronte Parsonage Museum.
