Minor Victorian Poets and Authors.
Welcome.  This web site is dedicated to the life and work of the Chartist, poet, author, and free thinker,
Gerald Massey, and to comparable poets and authors of his era, a number of whom by their protests
were to influence social reform in
Victorian Britain.  Most had working-class backgrounds. My aim is to resurrect their writing, much of which has for many decades been unavailable outside of national archives
and university libraries, and to place it before a wider audience.
Ian Petticrew
Gerald Massey
(1828-1907)"They must find it hard to take Truth for Authority
who have so long mistaken Authority for Truth."

"A poor man cannot rival the
rich in luxury of life, but he can in luxury of knowledge.
He cannot furnish his house as the wealthy can, but he can
furnish his head.  He cannot found a house of note, but
he may found a mind of mark.  Though some kingdoms may
be adorned or afflicted with kings, learning has always been
a republic, where all are equal who know."

RE-SOUNDING
RADICALISM: ECHO IN WILLIAM
BLAKE AND THE CHARTIST POETS
ERNEST JONES
AND GERALD MASSEY:
a thesis by Dr. Nichi McCawley, which argues that
William Blake’s poetry creates meaning through internal poetic
echoes, and that these Blakean echoes re-sound in Ernest Jones and
Gerald Massey’s Poetry. Reproduced by kind permission of the author.

LIFE OF ERNEST JONES:

permission of the author and the Editor of
Humanities Research (The
Australian National University) in
which the essay was first published.
MORRISON,
ALAN
BLAZE A VANISHING (A
TRAIL OF SMALL FIRES):
a long poem, or rather, blazing trail of thematically-linked verses,
in which the poet charts what he describes as the ‘shadow lineage’
of the more obscure, lesser known, even entirely ‘forgotten’ British
‘working-class’ poets and writers of the past four centuries.
