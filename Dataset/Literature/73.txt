ABOUT US
The Sherlock Holmes Memorabilia Company was successfully launched in 1991 as the only retailer in the world exclusively dedicated to the sale of Sherlockian memorabilia, acquiring its UK registered trademark in 1997.
Since its inception The Sherlock Holmes Memorabilia Company has traded internationally across all continents and remains the only recognised Sherlock Holmes brand in the world. With a portfolio of over 100 unqiue products, orginal images (archive library), Granada TV (Jeremy Brett) film set & props, website/domain names and internationally registered trademarks.
When Arthur Conan Doyle first introduced Sherlock Holmes to the reading public in 1887, nothing could have prepared him for the fact he had created a character who was destined to become the most famous detective in the world.
The Sherlock Holmes company manages the primary Sherlock Holmes Brand. Within this website we hope to provide you with information on Sherlock Holmes. Please go to the Forum to enter your input to the community.
