The game is still afloat! It’s been 25 years since the crew first set sail; it was the 29th of February 1992 to be precise as to detail (yes, we were taking a leap into unchartered waters). If you have memories of life on board the S.S. May Day which you’d like to share, we’d really love to hear from you. For a little bit of our history, click here and to get in touch, click here.
