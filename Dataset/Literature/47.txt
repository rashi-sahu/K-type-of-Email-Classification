Welcome
The Housman Society was founded in 1973 and exists to promote knowledge and appreciation of the lives and works of A.E. Housman and other members of his family.
Publications and literature
The Society also promotes the causes of literature and poetry in general. It produces an annual Journal and Newsletter, and organises Events such as discussions, visits and poetry readings. Commemorations are held in Bromsgrove on 26th March (A.E. Housman's birthday) and in Ludlow on 30th April, the date of A.E.H's death".
Sponsorship
It sponsors an annual lecture under the title "The Name and Nature of Poetry" at the Hay Festival of Literature in May/June each year.
Centennial celebrations
1996 was the centenary of the publication of A Shropshire Lad and the climax to a year of varied celebration was the dedication of a window to A.E. Housman in Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey.
