Pembrokeshire Marine SAC
Introduction
This site provides information on why part of Pembrokeshire is a European Marine Site, what marine life can be found here, what is being done to protect that wildlife, and what you can do to protect the site for the future.
The Pembrokeshire Marine Special Area of Conservation (SAC) designation is recognition that the area is one of the best in Europe for its marine wildlife.
However, the area also includes one of the busiest ports in the UK, is important for fisheries, and the coast attracts a great many visitors.
The local economy is heavily reliant upon tourism and recreation, as well as the commercial activities within the Milford Haven Waterway.
These interests, and the duty to look after the marine wildlife of the site, need to be looked at together; they cannot be considered in isolation. It is for this reason that all those with a responsibility for the area are involved in the siteâ€™s management.

The site was first identified as a Possible Special Area of Conservation in March 1995, followed by public consultation.
The Pembrokeshire Islands possible SAC was submitted by the UK Government to the European Commission as a candidate SAC in October 1997. The Pembrokeshire Islands SAC was renamed during the moderation process in 2000 as the Pembrokeshire Marine SAC. The site was finally designated in December 2004.
