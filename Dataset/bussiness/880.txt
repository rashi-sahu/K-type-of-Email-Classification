Vultures (Organic Cotton)

Notify me when this product is available:
In line with Mau Mau’s social commentary and our detest for the corporate monoliths, we bring you ‘Vultures’. This design draws themes from the Coca Cola branding with two suited vultures perched on the famous Coca Cola underline, peering out over the concrete plains.
This tee isn’t us saying money is bad, this tee symbolises the mentality of the ever growing corporate regime that takes and takes, much like the hungry vulture.

In line with our fish series, Mau Mau adds another to the books with his cool design depicting a THTC activist/mascot (The Hazmat Man) carrying a golden mermaid away from a waste and oil infested shoreline.
The piece draws on satire, folklore and of course activism, it may not be a pretty mermaid but EVERY fish counts in this delicate balance called our ecosystem.
We love this piece as it really visualises the mission here at THTC and as a popular seller we bring you this back in new colour ways in both hemp and organic cotton this winter. Pictured: Dizraeli and DJ Downlow.  Photo by Chelone Wolf.

Evil Mac (Organic Cotton)
£22.00
Notify me when this product is available:
‘Evil Mac’ is one of the signature caricatures created in the mind of Mau Mau. This popular design is 12 years strong and one of the very first pieces commissioned for THTC. The piece stems from a strong belief against the practice and effects huge fast food companies have on our planet and economy.
Whether it be tax evasion or highlighting the lack of nutrition in their food, Mau Mau’s ‘Evil Mac’ series is a reminder to the people on the cut throat methods the fast food industry uses to feed its customers at cheap costs. Worn by artists and celebrities the world over including those pictured below: Actor Ed Skrein and actor / musician Josh Whitehouse.  (photo by Chelone Wolf)

Notify me when this product is available:
Another powerful piece from THTC resident artist, Mau Mau. Invoking powerful imagery from the Black Live Matter movement, and recalling our hugely successful Free Burma design of 2008. Some things change, but the struggle stays the same.
15% of retail sales from this design will go directly to INQUEST, a charity that provides support to the families of people that have died in police custody. INQUEST’s casework and monitoring service has recorded over 4,500 deaths in prison and in police custody in England and Wales between 1990 and 2013. Many of these deaths have raised serious issues of negligence, systemic failures to care for the vulnerable, institutional violence, racism, inhumane treatment and abuse of human rights.
Help us support INQUEST's vital work in supporting families' and communities' search for justice and peace.
Also available in various colours on men's hemp tees and men's organic cotton tees.

The 'Great Blonde Hope' has descended from his sky-throne, high above New York City to lay his wrath upon those he sees unfit to be part of his New Order: peoples of colour, with disabilities and of course, the most dangerous of all - women.
Created by Hicks, one of THTC's newest collaborators.
Also, available as a men's tee here.

Perturbation, yo.
Bovine TB is running rampant throughout rural Britain, and the humble badger is to blame. Or are they? Could intensive dairy practices, widespread antibiotic resistance from heavy veterinary medication, and unsustainable marketing-driven consumption be the real reasons?
Who knows. We're just a t-shirt company. We love badgers. As does internationally renowned graffiti artist, Mau Mau who made this design. So here we are.
10% of all sales from these t-shirts and vests will go to Badger Trust UK, the leading badger conservation charity in the UK.

Start 'em young.
When you're a clothing brand and eco-community that's been around for over 17 years, it's pretty likely that a few of your fam are going to start having kids of their own. So we at THTC got broody - introducing the first design in our new baby-grow range.
‘Get Rich’ is a playful tongue in cheek rewording of 50 cent’s infamously titled album and film, ‘Get Rich Or Die Trying’. The character, portrayed as Tiny Tim from Charles Dicken’s ‘The Christmas Carol’, is seen painting the statement ‘Get Rich Or Try Sharing’ on a wall. The message is one of compassion and a change of heart, which of course is the central theme surrounding the Dickens’ story.
Printed on organic cotton.

Our second collaboration with Sheffield-based design wunderkund, The Tribes. From 2005-2015, 71 Americans were killed in terrorist attacks on US soil. By stark contrast 301,797 were killed by gun violence in during the same period.
Of the 30 people on average killed a day in American gun violence, roughly half are black men - who comprise just 6% of the population. In the same breath that hails God declaring all life as sacred, the same Conservative Americans refuse to relinquish their fetish of weapons of death.

Again playing on Disney characters, Mau Mau delivers a funny but very sinister truth about our society and the trust we place in the box in our living rooms.
This image is an adaptation of the scene in jungle book as Kaa the snake tries to hypnotise Mowgli and lead him astray, much like the hyper-reality being sold to us daily. The average person in the UK witnesses around 3,500 marketing messages a day and around 2hrs 30 mins of TV adverts a day which is to approximately 18 hrs and 9 minutes a week. You’ve been warned!
The design is printed in the UK using water-based, GOTS certified inks. This t-shirt was certified by GOTS and Control Union. THTC also works with Responsible 100 to further ensure transparency in our production line.
