IMF and Eurozone Agree Common Stance on Greece
Reuters reports that the IMF and Eurozone have finally come to an agreement as to what they will say to Greece today.
A
meeting between the lenders and Greek officials is scheduled for later today, the head of euro zone finance ministers Jeroen Dijsselbloem
said in The Hague.
"There
is agreement to present a united front to the Greeks," the eurozone
official said, adding that the outcome of Friday's meeting with the
Greeks was still unclear and it was unclear if Athens would accept the
proposals.
I think it fair to say that if the IMF and Eurozone really have come to a common stance, then Greece will not like it!

Whither The Prophesied Brexit Armageddon?
Manufacturing grew strongly Q4, up 1.2% from the previous Q3 -- stronger than poll of economists suggested.— Andrew Neil (@afneil) February 10, 2017
Industrial output rose 1.1% in Dec, stronger than expected 0.2% increase in Reuters poll. Year-on-year growth 4.3%, best since Jan '11— Andrew Neil (@afneil) February 10, 2017
Construction grew by more than expected 1.8% in Dec (v Nov), helped by building of houses/commercial property. ONS keeps Q4 GDP at +0.6%— Andrew Neil (@afneil) February 10, 2017
British exports to non-EU countries rose 17.3% in Q4. Exports to EU rose 3.5%. Trade balance has narrowed.— Andrew Neil (@afneil) February 10, 2017

Malloch Predicts Grexit and Euro Demise
Ted Malloch, the US ambassador to the EU, expects Greece to leave to euro and suspects that the eurozone's days are numbered.
As per Zerohedge:
“If the [IMF] will not participate in a new bailout that does not
include substantial debt relief, and that’s what they are saying, then
that, more or less, ensures a collision course with eurozone creditors.
Now we all know that primarily [puts pressure on] Germany, which remains opposed to any such actions, so I think it suggests that Greece might have to sever ties and do Grexit and exit the euro."
Suffice to say the EU doesn't want to hear defeatist talk like this, and is collectively whining at full pitch about Malloch's appointment!

Greece's Oncoming Explosion
The International Monetary Fund has warned that Greece’s debts are on an
“explosive” path, despite years of bailouts and half hearted economic
reforms.
This oncoming explosion existentially threatens the eurozone itself.
The solution according to the IMF is debt forgiveness.
However, as noted many times before on this site, neither Germany nor the other members of the Quadriga (sans IMF) have forgiveness in their hearts.
Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Eurogroup President repeated the mantra saying there would be no Greek debt forgiveness and dismissing
the IMF assessment of Greece’s growth prospects as overly pessimistic.
This will not end well!

Greece - The Crisis That Refuses To Go Away
Despite the media's obsession with Trump, there are other issues in the world.
One such issue being the ongoing Greek financial crisis, which has not gone away and is not likely to be solved.
Those who are optimistic for the chances of a solution should bear in mind that the IMF doesn't think that Greek debt is sustainable and that a write down is required. Germany, however, won't countenance a write down.
In short, there are no signs of a solution.

RBS Increases Provisions For Fines
RBS announced on Thursday that it has set aside a further $3.8 billion to cover
expected fines from U.S. authorities over its handling of residential
mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis.
RBS said the additional provision would mostly be for a penalty expected to be imposed by the Department of Justice
and other agencies over its issuing and underwriting of U.S.
residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) during the U.S. housing
boom of the 2000s.
RBS’s total package for provisions related to the mortgage-selling misconduct now stands at $8.3 billion.
