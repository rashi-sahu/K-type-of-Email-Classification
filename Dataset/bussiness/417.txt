Acupuncture treatment, acupressure therapy and moxibustion in central London, W8, W11, W14, SW 3, SW5, Kensington and South Kensington South West London SW18, SW19, Earlsfields, Southfields and Wimbledon Acupuncture, herbal medicine and homeopathy are highly effective alternative therapies used for a wide range of conditions: see list on the conditions pageChinese AcupunctureAcupuncture is part of a system of medicine which originated in China thousands years ago. The principal method of treatment is by inserting very fine needles into acupuncture points which lie on meridians
beneath the skin. These acupuncture points may also be treated by warming with a burning herb (moxibustion), by gentle electrical pulse (electro-acupuncture), or by laser.Acupuncture is a world wide medicine: it is used in almost every country in the world. It is estimated that there are currently more than
3 millions practicing acupuncturists, including barefoot doctors. Acupuncture takes years to learn: a qualified practitioner of traditional Chinese Medicine needs many years of study and clinical practice in order to refine his diagnostic and therapeutic skills. Acupuncture is a complex system which requires extensive study of the classical theory, profound knowledge of both theory and practice, and the necessary background in western medicine as well.Acupuncture for fertility: Acupuncture for IVF supportI have 30 years experience in helping with male and female infertility, and all the conditions associated with pregnancy and afterbirth as well as PCOS, endometriosis and other gynecological problems. Acupuncture for IVF support increases the chance of success by up to 65%My two children were born naturally with the help of acupuncture and homeopathy In many cases, I helped women who had difficulties conceiving; after a course of acupuncture, they became pregnant. When these ladies wanted an other child, they again had problems. After a second course of acupuncture, they became pregnant a second time. For me this is probably the most rewarding part of my work: there is no better feeling than when one of my patient call me to let me know that she is pregnant, or when the mother turns up at my practice, to show me her newborn babyAcupuncture for painThe
acupuncture pain clinic is open every day"I am here to make you feel better.I have the tools and the expertise to treat a wide range of painful acute or chronic conditions. I often combine alternative therapies for quick pain relief and

"This must be the finest book of its type.It has excellent information on every possible food and its effectiveness.Photography is superb and attractive.Recipes are simple and appetising. There is no jargon,the information given is precise and concise and well-indexed,so that the reader can either refer to the ailment or the food when seeking information.It is a clear guide to healthy eating."
.I've been on the daily program for 2 weeks now and I already feel a difference in the overall tone of my face. I like the way this book promotes a healthy alternative to preserving and resurecting younger skin. It's also a good read if you're interested in learning some fascinating basics about oils & aromatherapy. Aesthetically, I love this book. Great combination of instructional pic's and informative advice.

The tall, grey-haired, bespectacled Frenchman has a reassuringly competent manner and a no-nonsense approach to treatment. That's just as well, since clients include some pernickety members of the Royal Family. ''He's rather sardonic and French,'' reports one patient. ''If you say 'Ow' when he sticks in a needle, he shrugs and says, 'But I can feel nothing.'''The Kensington Therapy Centre, 213 Kensington High Street, London W8 (020 7376 1199); and at Cure-by-Nature, 95 Replingham Road, Southfields, London SW18 (020 8875 1101; www.cure-by-nature.co.uk); £50.
