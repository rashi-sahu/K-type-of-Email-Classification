The History of the BAS
The Bankruptcy Advisory Service Limited is an entirely independent organisation.
Unlike so many other debt advice companies, we are rather unique in that we have no vested interest in the advice which we provide. We simply provide impartial advice to anyone struggling with severe financial problems.
We do not receive any grants or funding, however, all of our clients find their way to us by recommendation, therefore, with no advertising costs, we are able to maintain our minimal subscription fee of just £25.00.
We hope you will find our site both informative and interesting. Should you wish to gain advice from us, you may either subscribe online or telephone us on 01423 862114
