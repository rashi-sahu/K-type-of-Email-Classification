e-Go aeroplanes are seeking a buyer to move the company into full production of the single-seat aircraft and future production of the multi-seat variants.
The e-Go is a remarkably light single seat aircraft. At the cutting edge of design and material innovation, it defines a new category of leisure aviation. We call it the “fun flying machine”. The two variants e-Go and e-Go+ are priced at £50k (+VAT) and £60k (+VAT) respectively.
The e-Go+ variant includes EFIS, System Integration Device, 8.33kHz radio and ADSB Mode S transponder from Trig.
