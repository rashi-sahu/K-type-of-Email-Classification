About
Industrial carbon emissions are high, and are continuing to rise with increasing economic activity. The need to limit climate change means that carbon emissions have to reduce rapidly. US data shows that the gap between actual and target emissions is already huge.

Oil and gas contain carbon, and energy is released when it reacts with air. By controlling this reaction it is possible to generate electricity, as well as converting the carbon into a useful product instead of carbon dioxide. We call this clean carbon energy. Conversion to CO2 pollutes the atmosphere, and wastes a valuable resource. Omnagen can provide a way to harness this energy. Read more...
Diesel engines are more fuel-efficient than petrol/gasoline engines, but their NOx and particulate emissions cause problems, most notably in cities. Hybrid vehicles operating in "electric-mode" produce no pollution, which is good for city use. However, fuel efficiency on longer distances needs improvement. Omnagen has a solution. Read more...
Replacing outdated and wasteful chemical processes
Climate change matters, and outdated and wasteful chemical processes add significantly to global emissions. The processes have been refined over the years, but many were originally developed over a century ago when energy was cheap and emissions weren’t a consideration. More than a gigatonne of carbon dioxide a year can be saved by using a different approach, by producing clean carbon energy, incorporating the Omnagen Cell. This website provides some information, but do contact Ken Omersa if you'd like to know more; phone and email details are provided here.
