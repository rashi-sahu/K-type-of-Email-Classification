The Creativity Partnership
The Creativity Partnership helps organisations get value from creativity, providing workshops, training and consultancy. Clients include the NHS, Procter & Gamble, Sainsbury’s, Rolls Royce and Cambridge University.
The Creativity Partnership was founded by Anne Miller in 2001, initally as a subsidiary of TTP Group, one of Europe’s leading independent technology innovation organisations.  Following a buy-out in 2004, The Creativity Partnership is now entirely independent of TTP. All projects are delivered by Anne Miller.
See the rest of this website for examples of the company’s work.
