Welcome to Industrial Britain
This Website is dedicated to documenting and recording the Industry of Britain
The
past two decades have seen a dramatic decline in the industries that were once common throughout Britain. Since the beginning of the
1980's there have been mass closures of Steel mills,
Coke Works, Collieries, Coal fired Power Stations, Refineries, Chemical
Works, Textile Mills, Factories and Shipyards
