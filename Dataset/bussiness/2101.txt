World Class Recruitment
with a Regional Focus
Two words sum up why Cooper Lomaz is the go-to recruitment agency: brilliantly connected. This simple but meaningful phrase is at the heart of everything we do. It defines and drives our business. It inspires and empowers everyone in our highly skilled, highly trained team to deliver nothing less than outstanding performance.
It’s not just about connecting dynamic employers with high-calibre professionals. It’s not just about being totally in touch with the markets in which we operate and the latest trends that are relevant to them. It goes much further than that. We’re brilliantly connected through our extensive face-to-face networking with hirers and influencers.
We’re brilliantly connected through our involvement in key events and industry-wide initiatives. We’re brilliantly connected locally, nationally and internationally. And of course, we’re brilliantly connected online, taking full advantage of new media and technology.
Brilliantly connected isn’t a strapline. It’s a state of mind. It’s what sets us apart from other recruitment agencies. And it’s what makes us an award-winning market leader in key industry sectors, from accountancy and engineering to sales and supply chain. Energy, enterprise, commitment, insight, know-how, access – it all comes together at Cooper Lomaz.
