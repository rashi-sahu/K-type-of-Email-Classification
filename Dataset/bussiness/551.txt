Hybrid Ventilation
Air quality and thermal comfort are crucial for any building. On warm days, the benefits of natural ventilation are obvious – bountiful amounts of fresh air and a connection with nature help create a healthy, happy environment. In cooler weather, a purely natural system can struggle to provide sufficient fresh air without causing unwelcome cold draughts. Breathing Buildings pioneered the concept of ‘mixing ventilation’ and is the world leader in controlled hybrid ventilation systems.
