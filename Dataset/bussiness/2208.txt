BERG - the BioEnergy Research Group at Aston University is one of the largest university based research groups in Freespin thermal biomass conversion in the world. It was formed in 1986 as a focus for a range of inter-related activities in biomass conversion and environmental studies related to global warming and has grown into a substantial multi-disciplinary research effort.
Our Mission - "To apply chemical engineering science and technology to help provide the world with sufficient energy, fuels and chemicals from renewable and sustainable biomass resources to meet tomorrow's needs."
BERG is one of the research groups in Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry (CEAC) in the School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS) at Aston University.
BERG is a founder member of the European Bioenergy Research Institute (EBRI)

In order to utilize the chemical energy of biomass, it has to be processed either thermally, biologically or mechanically. BERG focuses its efforts on thermal processing and particularly fast pyrolysis for production of liquids that can be used as fuels for power and/or heat production; for production of transport fuels; or as a source of chemicals. When multiple products are derived, this is often refered to as a biorefinery.
