Welcome to Forecast Flow – Expert Financial Management for Start Ups & SMEs –
Forecast Flow, “The Forward Facing Accountant” helps companies, through financial management, to improve their financial systems, controls and reporting, so they can make effective business decisions and plan for the future.
.
Forecast Flow provides start up companies with the financial management of a Finance Manager (Financial Controller), which larger companies take for granted.
Start Ups and SMEs (small and medium size enterprises) do not have the resources nor the need to employ a finance professional full time, but they still need the same level of attention, care and expertise larger companies would expect to have on a continuing basis.
The services provided by Forecast Flow to your company are designed to ensure the company management team receive the information they need to run the company, which then:
Allows the CEO / Managing Director to concentrate on running the company rather than being side tracked into producing financial information, which can be both costly and time consuming.
Ensures the financial systems, controls and reporting are implemented and/or improved so the finance function runs efficiently and transactions are processed and reports produced in a timely manner.
Results in management having relevant and reliable financial information, so they can make proactive business decisions and can plan for the future.
