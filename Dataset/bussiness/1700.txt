about us
Jupiter combines the spirit and flair of an investment boutique with the strength and resources of an established institution.
Jupiter is an established fund management group that seeks to add value for our clients through the delivery of outperformance over the medium to long term. Our origins go back to 1985 as a specialist investment boutique founded in London. Since then we have expanded beyond the UK as retail and institutional investors have been attracted to our active approach to asset management.
Although we are now too large to be considered a boutique – we manage £40.5 billion in total* – we work hard on retaining our boutique culture. We believe this is why some of the finest fund managers in the industry choose to pursue their careers with us.

our philosophy
