Un-contacted tribes of the forests
16th February 2017 Nick Grealy Leave a comment
Here’s a story based on cultural anthropology, the study of human cultures.  Culture is bottom up. The story of man is from individuals to families, to bands, to groups, to villages, to tribes, to cities to countries – and today to the world.
Deep in the Amazon rain forest there still remain uncontacted tribes, human who by choice or geography have no contact with the outside world. Some are near natural gas reserves:

World’s greatest wind success story. Happening because of natural gas
14th February 2017 Nick Grealy Leave a comment
Imagine the celebration if even a single European country exceeded 50% of power generation from wind. On Twitter at least, we would never hear the end of it. Who needs onshore natural gas when we have so much wind would be the inevitable conclusion, an interpretation widely distributed to the Fourth Estate and the other temporal powers.   That would lead  aside of course that two thirds of natural gas, now imported even from the high carbon/zero tax Peruvian Amazon Rain Forest in deference to our own low carbon/high tax resources, is used not in generation but for domestic heating and industry. But the milestone is very significant all the same. It’s, as far as I’m concerned, a fantastic breakthrough.
This should be great news: The 52% share of wind generating electricity the other morning in the US South West Power Pool is inarguably an incredible achievement: Continue reading World’s greatest wind success story. Happening because of natural gas →

Scotland shale gas
13th February 2017 Nick Grealy Leave a comment
Why should someone who wants to explore for shale gas in London care what’s going on in Scotland? Simply put, a ban on shale gas in Scotland would naturally make the case for shale in England and London harder.  That’s not only because at the last census 90,000 Scottish people live in London (more than from Jamaica, Somalia or Sri Lanka). It disrupts the narrative of shale, so lets  at least get the story straight.
There’s a consultation going on in Scotland on shale gas which will probably decide that exploration in Scotland may be OK, but hold off until after Cuadrilla and Third Energy’s results before taking any exploration plunge. Continue reading Scotland shale gas →

Global Shale Gas: What Now What Next. This year’s model coming soon
8th February 2017 Nick Grealy Leave a comment
Let’s imagine it’s February 2010
The conventional wisdom saw this:
On 10 February 2010 at the Royal Society, six UK companies – Arup, Foster + Partners, Scottish and Southern Energy, Solarcentury, Stagecoach Group and Virgin – joined together to launch the second report of the UK Industry Task-Force on Peak Oil and Energy Security (ITPOES).

Natural gas under London. Let’s look!
6th February 2017 Nick Grealy 3 Comments
This project is going to take up most of my time both, here and at a new site coming soon. Any questions? Get in touch. Guru at nohotair.co.uk
We have much to say and this will be the first of a series that will answer the following  questions, and many more, in detail over coming weeks and months.  For now, all we can do is think, but ultimately we will act. It will be a great journey.  This is just the first step. Please get in touch with any further questions and we’ll do our best to answer them.
Q: Why should we explore for natural gas under London?

Robin Hood in reverse: Sherwood Forest “fracking” opponents rob from the poor to give to the rich.
26th January 2017 Nick Grealy 2 Comments
Like all good insurrections, the opposition to “fracking” in Sherwood Forest risks snowballing and damaging everyone else  unless some facts are allowed to enter the debate.
Facts certainly aren’t intruding into this story from the local paper.  What could  then happen is that, like the original Telegraph story, these “alternative facts” become viral.  A local newspaper reporter, perhaps earning as little as £12 a year,  writes a story essentially dictated to her by Guy Shrubsole of Friends of the Earth. Other reporters worldwide will find it via Google and embellish it for their local story, producing a  digital palimpsest mirroring the medieval tone of the story. Result: anti fracking activists invigorate themselves as participants in a mythic battle.

US energy is their problem, and the UK’s
22nd January 2017 Nick Grealy Leave a comment
There’s some danger where the febrile atmosphere of US politics could run risks for the UK shale and climate debate. The US need some reality checks from both sides of the debate before their, and the UK’s, middle gets involved.
US fears from both sides are condensed here by Gregory Meyer, at the FT: Continue reading US energy is their problem, and the UK’s →

God’s Work: Shale and the Church of England
19th January 2017 Nick Grealy 2 Comments
One way for No Hot Air and our readers to feel old is recalling how I was described as a shale gas missionary in the pages of Petroleum Economist  way back when it actually had pages in September 2010.
NICK GREALY has been causing a stir. A former consultant who has spent two decades in the energy sector, he’s on a one-man mission to persuade the world of the virtues of shale gas. He does it through a blog called No Hot Air.
It’s a platform for him, his views and his trumpeting of the unconventional  gas revolution that has swept the US, and believes Grealy, will do the same elsewhere – if only people, especially in the UK Government, would wake up to reality.

Footprint, footprint, footprint. The mundane reality of natural gas
17th January 2017 Nick Grealy 1 Comment
The attraction of UK onshore natural gas has always been location, location, location.  If we are even allowed to explore for it, let alone possibly produce it, it  is under a market that uses a lot of imports and will need a growing amount of them as we continue to install a new or upgraded heating system every 6 seconds of a 50 hour working week.  All into a market steps away from a distribution system bought and paid for years ago, at a commodity price that has a basis over US Henry Hub permanently built in.
But throughout the debate we should have talked, footprint, footprint, footprint. Nothing else matters. The smallest footprint possible makes onshore gas (and oil) acceptable, achievable – and profitable.  Yet the fundamental fear of journalists has been an outdated view of gas wells on every street corner.
