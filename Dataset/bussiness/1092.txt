Nine Tiles
developers of digital networks for time-critical media
We have over 30 years' experience of developing
digital networking systems.
Our Flexilink technology meets the requirements for 21st-century digital networks that IP can't meet, including:
Lowest possible latency for live media
Low per-packet overheads (both header size and processing requirement)
Flexible addressing
Support for mobility and security
Ease of management
An outline of the rationale behind Flexilink is here.
We also play a leading role in international standardisation, including ETSI ISG NGP, MPEG, AESSC SC-02, and IEC Project Team 62379, which is developing a Common Control Interface to make it easy to configure and control networked audiovisual equipment (see www.iec62379.org).
Download from here ITU-T's report on applications that need the low latency our Flexilink technology provides.
Flexilink digital network technology
provides a guaranteed, low-latency service for media streams even when sharing the network with other traffic
transparent, efficient, and easy to manage -- no need for elaborate traffic management
