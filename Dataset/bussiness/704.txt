What we do
Cyclofluidic is using CyclOps™, its proprietary microfluidic drug discovery platform, to revolutionise hit and lead optimisation.
CyclOps™ connects flow chemistry, purification, screening and drug design with complex algorithms allowing drug lead molecules to be assayed minutes, rather than weeks, after they are designed. Using the power of flow chemistry, developed in the labs of Prof Steve Ley at Cambridge University, our unique approach puts synthesis, screening and molecular design firmly back together in a single laboratory allowing fast iterative exploration of vast areas of diverse chemical space.
CyclOps™ is the ultimate lean approach to lead discovery, allowing us to optimise hits in real time, making and screening only those key compounds that progress a hypothesis towards the best possible lead molecules.
