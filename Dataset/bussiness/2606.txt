Agricultural labour in the UK
The UK’s agricultural workforce has always been on the frontline of change. As an industrialising country the UK went through the world’s first technology-driven economic transition, and in the present day a further wave of innovation in agri-tech looks poised to decimate the workforce once again. This trend will continue to be reinforced by the government’s policy of promoting agri-technology and encouraging trade patterns that tend to import high-labour products and export low-labour products.

Time to count the hungry: The case for a standard UK measure of household food insecurity
The UK currently does not measure household food insecurity, defined as insufficient or insecure access to food due to resource constraint. The absence of regular, accurate data keeps the magnitude of the problem hidden, allowing for government inaction.
Time to count the hungry argues that the UK would benefit from using a standard measure of household food insecurity, which could be used to monitor the problem as part of existing social and health surveys.
