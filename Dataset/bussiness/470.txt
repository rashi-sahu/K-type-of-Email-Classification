Welcome to ASSM
Cost Saving With Peace of Mind for Business
ASSM enables businesses to identify problems, threats and opportunities that result in significant cost savings.
Whether we’re helping you to develop an asset management system, implementing a business resilience plan, or ensuring your facility relocation runs smoothly, ASSM will deliver cost savings and peace of mind to your business.
Cost savings for physical assets
In the 21st century, business success relies on reducing and managing expenditure proactively, as well as improving products and services.
Managing expenditure well is a real challenge for businesses, both large and small. By implementing resilient, transparent processes to gain clear visibility of life cycle costs from purchase to disposal and developing a structured asset management system this challenge can be met.
Business resilience
Business continuity planning is a critical part of business resilience. An effective business continuity plan provides peace of mind by reducing the impact of unplanned events. Business processes and their dependencies can be evaluated through a business impact analysis (BIA) to identify potential business continuity risks. Once risks have been identified, mitigation can be carried out where possible and contingency plans embedded.
Facility relocation planning
A business or facility relocation is a significant undertaking that should be planned and executed with a full understanding of all business requirements for the new site.
ASSM delivers the following business benefits:
1. Save money
Cost saving with peace of mind for your business.
Developing effective cost forecasts that eliminate unexpected expenditure is one of the best ways to save money and gain peace of mind.
Manage and reduce costs
By implementing a professional asset management system, all assets can be identified and their location, capital cost, operating costs, maintenance costs, dilapidation and depreciation costs can be managed.
Make informed purchases
Once an asset management system has been introduced and embedded, it can be used when purchasing new assets to identify the lowest life cycle costs, saving money and delivering the best value to the business.
Plan for future savings
The asset management and life cycle cost data can be used to plan ahead. Business decisions can be made based on reliability and operating cost data. Replacement of assets can be planned at the most effective time of the asset life cycle. This approach will save money year on year.
Using ASSM to implement an asset management system will enable your organisation to make evidence-based decisions to optimise asset performance aligned to your long-term business objectives.
2. Reduce Budgets
Using an asset management system reduces budgets because the transparency of data generated enables the true lifecycle costs of assets be more accurately forecast.
Good quality asset management data also improves the transparency of Capital asset investment on revenue budgets. This link is critical in budget planning as it allows revenue budgets to be reduced by identifying the lowest life cycle cost associated with capital purchase options.
3. Minimise unplanned disruptions
Minimising opportunities for unplanned business disruptions is a great way to save money.
Business continuity planning is an under used methodology of delivering business improvement, as people often think it is complex, expensive and not required. ASSM thrives on making the complicated simple.
Using business continuity processes, the critical elements of a business can be identified, business impact analysis assessed, risks mitigatedand contingency plans implemented.
No business wants to experience the impact and unexpected cost of unplanned disruptions. By putting simple business continuity plans in place, you can save money and achieve business peace of mind.
4. Plan relocations with minimum downtime
Facility relocation or new occupation can be disruptive to business, causing unexpected costs and loss of revenue income.
It is extremely important to have a good facilitator to manage the relocation or occupancy process, and to liaise with all people involved. Effective liaison with staff, management, service providers, suppliers and customers throughout the process is critical to minimising disruption and cost.
Having an external facilitator can be very beneficial, keeping the cost and time of staff involvement to a minimum, and enabling normal business to be delivered without disruption.
A well-managed relocation project requires detailed identification of all service, connectivity and equipment requirements, including new purchases. It is important that every dependency is thought of, as getting to a new location and realising something hasn’t been considered can be extremely disruptive.
The bottom line is that without effective facility relocation planning a business is vulnerable to disruption that results in extra costs, reduced income and lost business.
