The Forces Pension Society is your independent not-for-profit pension watchdog, fighting for the interests of the Armed Forces and their families.
With four pension schemes now in operation, Armed Forces Pensions have never been more complex.
We help our Members through the pension maze and campaign against injustices in the system as we did when winning the right of all widows to retain their pension on remarriage. We also sit on the MoD Pensions Board and on the Public Sector Pensioners Council representing our Members’ interests.
These are just a few of the unsolicited responses we receive from Members who have accessed our acknowledged experts in our Pension Advisory Service led by Lt Cdr David Marsh.
“Thanks for your detailed and easy-to-understand pension breakdown. I amended my PEN1 where I had ticked the box to inversely commute my ‘15, thinking it meant the same as commuting my ‘75. With your help I've now achieved what I wanted.”
Phil Babbington, FPS Member
“After you made me aware my pension may have been miscalculated, I can only thank you for your time in calculating what it should have been. My family has now been reimbursed with over £6,500 (which Mrs Bennett has already spent).”
Paul Bennett, FPS Member
“I received my tax-free lump sum last week and my first monthly pension payment. I wanted to thank you for your support and diligence to the plight I went through.”
Charlie Neve, FPS Member
“Thank you so much for your help and work in putting things right.
I thought there was something wrong but after two rejections of my own enquiries, success at last!”
Tony Smith, FPS Member
“I could not have received a simpler explanation. We need a guardian or at least a nightwatchman with a whistle, like FPS.”
Chris Henwood, FPS Member

What people are saying about us…
All very clear and such a quick reply! Well worth the membership fee!
Society Member
I have been in touch with SPVA office on 3 separate occasions all to no avail... rang back... no record of my previous call... received a new reference...rang back ... was told my enquiry had been closed off. I gave this some thought and then rang you today and we resolved the problem together.
Society Member
We found your brief informative, unbiased and most importantly an honest straightforward forward explanation of a complex subject. Even the 'old and bold' in the audience found much of what you had to say wholly relevant and, in some cases, entirely new. I am sure there will be many a submariner now making 'just in case' or 'death' files and contemplating voluntary contributions as well as seriously considering other well given advice.
Roadshow attendee
I joined the Medicash insurance scheme for members last June, and I should just like to say that I have been amazed by how good it is. I took out one insurance for me and one for my wife. We have been going to the normal sorts of minor treatments and check-ups one can expect at our ages, and Medicash has not once queried a claim or refused to pay.
Society Member
The Society has in the past year introduced a BUPA Dental Insurance Plan and I cannot do more than highly recommend them for its service and price.
Society Member
Thank you for taking the time to provide such an excellent brief on Armed Forces Pensions at RAF Cosford. The brief was highly informative, well received and was even described as entertaining. Well done!
Roadshow attendee
Thank you for your awesomely quick response. I’ve only been a member for a couple of weeks and I feel as though I have got full value for money already! It’s good to know that when I’m old and grey that my State Pension will be worth a bit more as a result of my SSC 6… Thanks again
Society Member
The AXA Travel Insurance Policy is excellent. I am 81 and my wife is 79 and my quotes for a 7 week visit to Australia came to £270 with AXA versus £700 to over £2,300 with other providers. I was struck down with food poisoning prior to returning, and the treatment I received was excellent. AXA have paid me nearly all my claim without argument, all I had to do was present a proper case.
Society Member
Thank you so much for my pension forecast! I am having such a hectic week I would never have been able to come up with the figures in time and would have zero confidence! I really appreciate your swift reply, too. Many thanks.
Society Member
This is indeed sensational and heart-warming news. The burden of worry will be lifted from the shoulders of so many women who have already suffered grievous loss.
comment on the Justice for Widows campaign
Well done FPS in achieving the widows pension victory over previous government intransigence. A real step forward.
comment on the Justice for Widows campaign
The briefing was extremely well attended, which demonstrates the high Level of interest in pensions and the importance of having an independent organisation such as Forces Pension Society that is able to offer and represent the interests of all 3 services. I know that those who attended left far more informed and with a better understanding of the AFPS 15, as well as the services FPS are able to provide.
Roadshow attendee
Your persistence, sound argument, intense lobbying and, probably, bloody-mindedness have paid off in the campaign for justice for widows.
comment on the Justice for Widows campaign
Thank you for your kind letter [following the death of his wife]... she was always very appreciative of all the work the FPS has done and continues to do on behalf of all the Armed Services…how much more your help is needed for the very different demands on our Servicemen and their families today...
Society Member
Thank you. You were enormously helpful and I now feel properly informed. What a pity the Chain of Command can’t offer anything similar…
Roadshow attendee
I attended the FPS brief this morning at MOD Abbey Wood and we spoke briefly afterwards. The content of the brief has really opened my eyes to what my options are in the very near future. I feel that the brief should be compulsory for all Servicemen and women at key stage of their careers.
Roadshow attendee
I write on behalf of Donnington Support Unit, HQ 11Signal Brigade, 3 RMP 174 Pro Coy and the HQ 143 Brigade Personnel Recovery Unit (PRU) to extend our appreciation on the pension's presentation you gave recently. It was a pleasant surprise that there was an encouraging representation from the younger members of the Army; emphasising the point about early dialogue and action with pension issues, will ensure a comprehensive understanding, if or when, the time arises.
Roadshow attendee
The comprehensive notes you sent about what I should do about pensions ... were enormously useful...it is wonderful to have the FPS behind one at times like that.
Society Member
After showing my Desk Officer your email …Manning have accepted my withdrawal of my Early Termination and reinstated me onto my original EED…which makes my pension £2000 a year better of. Many thanks for your help and investigation.
Society Member
I asked the FPS for advice on two specific issues last year. On both occasions the reply I received was simply outstanding and could not be faulted. The advice given was personalised and tailored. The individuals in question took the time and care to answer my query. Additionally, I spoke to one of your advisors at a FAR and he was excellent. The advice he gave perfectly reflected the advice I subsequently received by email (from another advisor). The consistency in advice was important. I am more than content to wait for excellent advice rather than receive “half-baked” advice in a shorter time frame. I also acknowledge you have sought to address the timeliness of responding to queries by two additional advisors (who I happened to meet last year at a FAR) Both appear to be real assets to the organisation- the HR department should be complimented! The additional benefits membership offers are great but as long as you continue to focus on your core output (from my perspective)- the offering of expert advice – then you will continue to have happy members.
Thank you for the sterling work you perform.
Society Member
I write on behalf of HMS ILLUSTRIOUS' Ship's Company to thank you for the extremely useful (and well attended) presentations you gave. The feedback has all been extremely positive. It was pitched exactly right; easy for all to understand as well as relevant by introducing the significant aspects of the new pension scheme and comparisons between the AFPS75 and 05. I know that the Society will have some new members as a result.
Roadshow attendee
I thought you should know the outcome, of the demand for return of a £65,000 ‘overpayment’ by MOD, following your recommendation. The result is for the overpayment to be completely written off. It’s been a very long and stressful 5 year battle, but with the right result eventually. Many thanks again for your advice and I hope you will continue to encourage others to ask questions and challenge demands wherever they have a case to do so.
Society Member
Thank you one and all for your persistent and ultimately successful campaign for us to retain our pensions on remarriage or co-habitation. You never gave up, you encouraged us all, and when governments refused to consider the arguments, regrouped and carried on. My beloved husband died nearly 14 years ago and even having met someone I loved I was unable to live with him or marry. You have lifted an enormous burden from me and my family. Thank you.
Society Member
I would like to pass on my thanks and appreciation to you and FPS for the excellent and comprehensive presentations you gave in Germany in July. It is reassuring to know that there is an organisation like yours that is there to represent the soldiers’ interests in both their career planning and unravelling the often baffling complexities of the AFPS.
Roadshow attendee
Thank you for your time and advice, would you also pass on my thanks to those who come out and give briefings at unit level as it was them who planted the seeds.
Roadshow attendee
Dear Lt Commander Marsh, Once again thank you for explaining things in plain English that I find easier to understand. I will certainly go on the internet and take a good look at the booklet you recommend.
Society Member
Thank you for visiting Keogh Barracks today to deliver a most informative briefing. I didn't envy you the wide range of attendees from Phase 2 trainee to Senior Officers, but you kept the whole audience engaged.
As you know better than most, the Armed Forces Pensions Schemes are particularly complex and your delivery and examples made it relatively easy to understand - even the tricky bits!
Roadshow attendee
Excellent! I’m proud to be a member.
comment on the Justice for Widows campaign
Bravo, truly excellent news – well done FPS.
comment on the Justice for Widows campaign
Good news regarding my IDRP complaint, my appeal has been up held and the money that they were demanding will be written off! Also any money owed to me will be repaid! Amazing, Once again thank you for all the help you gave me, it really did make a difference, up to that point I had felt very alone.
Society Member
The brief you gave today is the one I wish I had had 25 years ago! It has helped me make some big decisions about my remaining time in the Service, the first being to join the FPS!
Roadshow attendee
Judging by the show of hands at the end of your presentation indicated that it was very worthwhile and also tells me that you did not have a wasted journey. In addition to this, the fact the majority of the 250+ personnel present indicated that this presentation should be given to as many military personnel as possible also proves the point that it is more than worthwhile and, you are definitely not wasting your time, and will probably become even busier!
Roadshow attendee
I write to thank you for all the help the FPS has given me over the last years… I have now got my family pension re-instated which is wonderful news. Thank you for all you have done to help me over this difficult time. You are all doing great work.
Society Member
This is more than helpful and I appreciate your swift response. You have explained it much better than what SPVA did.
