Testimonial
Raptor SSC, Greg Bergsma, Chief Operating Officer
I worked with Gary in various roles from 1997 to 2007, as part of the distribution team at QNX Software, then as key members of the QNX Global sales force. Gary's experience with international markets from the USA and Canada, to Europe and EMEA, together with his collaborative style with customers, places him in a unique position to assist organisations who are looking to establish themselves in Europe/EMEA. The breadth of his relationships also bodes well for him to leverage situations to further deliver value for customers.
