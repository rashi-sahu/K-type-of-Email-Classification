Global Issues
Welcome to the global issues blog. This blog looks into global issues that affect everyone and aims to show the effect of ideology on the inter-related global issues. It also aims to provide a resource of articles and material to aid in understanding global issues. I am a freelance writer researching extensively into global issues such as international relations, geopolitics, Economics and the influence of ideology, globalisation and Islamic thought.
