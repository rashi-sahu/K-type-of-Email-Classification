Pricing Money: A Beginner’s Guide to Money, Bonds, Futures and Swaps
is an introduction to the fixed-income markets. It explains the purpose and design of the most important financial instruments, including deposits, bonds, futures and swaps, and how these instruments are used by the various players in the financial system.
The book is for new recruits and potential new recruits in financial markets (consider reading it before rather than after the interview), as well as accountants, lawyers, and those wishing to understand finance.
The style is engaging, accessible and non-mathematical, and hence comprehensible by those with no prior financial knowledge.
