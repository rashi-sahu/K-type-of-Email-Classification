Our customers are designers of electromechanical products seeking an innovative edge.  Resonant inductive technology helps simplify their product design and manufacture.  Position sensors are built from conventional PCBs, so that they are accurate, robust and manufacturable at low cost.
Founded in 2007, CambridgeIC has developed single chip processors and a set of standard sensor designs and integration tools.  These help customers embed resonant inductive sensing inside their products, by drawing on modular and well proven components.
