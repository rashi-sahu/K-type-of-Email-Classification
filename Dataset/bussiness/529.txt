welcome to black pig
As part of our growth plan we are now recruiting for the following position:   * Web Developer Black Pig operates an equal opportunities policy. We believe that honesty and informality are not contradictory to good business which is why as a Black Pig client you'll have a dedicated Account Manager to look after you who is responsible for the success of the work we undertake and the satisfaction of your relationship. Supporting them is a 20 strong team of passionate, creative and skilled individuals working hard to deliver your brand promises from offices in Royston, just south of Cambridge and in Soho, London. We’ve been around a while, since 1996, and in that time we’ve picked up more than our fair share of awards, we like to think that they take some of the unknown out of a new relationship and they recognise our achievements across our disciplines of brand development, strategic marketing, design communications, web design, new media and public relations. Driven by marketing, realised through design and delivered by the latest technologies, Black Pig's continued success is attributable to thorough planning, creative excellence and the rigorous pursuit of doing a great job. You don’t have to take our word for it, have a look at our clients and work to see for yourself. We're proud of the company we keep.
