Ministers meet over credit crunch
Ministers are to discuss what can be done to ease economic woes
Stormont ministers have met to discuss the credit crunch in Northern Ireland.
A spokesman said the ministers had agreed to meet again to discuss the issue on Monday morning.
Discussions on details of a package of measures to help people suffering from the credit crunch will continue over the weekend.
The meeting took place amid reports of tensions over how money is being spent by the executive.
During the 150-day stand-off, all parties agreed that tackling the credit crunch and fuel poverty was a priority.
Measures approved since their return include Titanic Signature Project funding and deferral of water charges.
However, Social Development Minister Margaret Ritchie's plan for a £200 electricity credit for vulnerable households has not yet been approved.
There have been reports of tensions between ministers, with some accusing their SDLP colleague of unduly raising people's expectations.
On Wednesday, the fuel poverty plan was criticised by Sinn Féin which questioned whether Northern Ireland Electricity should be given £13m.
A Department of Social Development spokesperson said NIE would not benefit financially from any proposed fuel credit payment.
