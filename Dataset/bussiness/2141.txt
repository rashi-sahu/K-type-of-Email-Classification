London & Cambridge is an international Executive Search and Talent Consultancy firm set up at the turn of the century.
We search for senior/board Technology, Media, Communications, Science and Innovation talent. Senior base salaries are in the range $150k-$500k (£100k-£310k / €110-€340k).
Our Technology, Media & Communications clients benefit from our line experience to MD/XVP level with market leaders (e.g. Google, Vodafone, Universal Music, Virgin). So we think first from our client's business perspective, and then which talent solution offers the answer.
We work with clients focused on Value (for their Money). They are typically WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You get) authentic companies - customers, shareholders and employees / candidates receive a consistent fair (and often exciting) experience.
We deliver a fair return to them from:
knowledge of Technology, Media & Communications market and talent trends
empathy/enthusiasm for clients and candidates
hybrid, unusual Technology, Media & Communications talent networks
