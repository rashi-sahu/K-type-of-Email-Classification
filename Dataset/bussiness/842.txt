COME AND JOIN US ON OUR ADVENTURE!We are the leading charity for girls and young women in Wales. Thanks to our amazing 4,000 volunteers, we deliver life-changing adventures and opportunities to over 18,000 girls aged from 5 to 25. We give girls a VOICE and have done for over 100 years! We’ve listened to all our girls, volunteers and friends and are launching our new ‘Being Our Best’ programme…What an exciting time to be part of this amazing organisation. At the end of 2015, we drew together thoughts and ideas from Members across Girlguiding Cymru to develop a strategic plan for the next five years. This plan defines where we want to be in Girlguiding in Wales by 2021, what we plan to do to get there and how our actions support Girlguiding UK’s plans.    “Being Our Best – Bod Ein Gorau” is Girlguiding Cymru’s strategic plan for 2016 – 2021.Our commitment is to meet these strategic aims by giving all our volunteers support so they can be inspirational leaders and by offering every girl the chance to be her best and to have her voice heard.  “Being Our Best – Bod Ein Gorau” has always been at the heart of everything we do in guiding. Supporting our Leaders, listening to our members, telling others about what we do and having strong behind-the-scenes support is essential.If you are interested in joining Girlguiding or Volunteering your time, please register your interest.
