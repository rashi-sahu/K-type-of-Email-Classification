We are pleased to announce that we have opened our new manufacturing facility in Craiova, Romania, which specialises in the production of cable assemblies and box build.
Cable Assemblies
At GTK, we can manufacture a range of cable assemblies, including microwave and RF products, overmoulded cables, and wiring looms. Over 95% of our cable assemblies are customised in some way.

Optoelectronic products are used increasingly in both consumer and industrial electronics. We can offer technical support to select and design the most suitable device for our customers' requirements.
Connectors
We offer a broad range of standard & custom I/O, board-to-board & wire-to-board connectors for PCB interconnect. We also offer customised solutions to meet customers' specific requirements.
