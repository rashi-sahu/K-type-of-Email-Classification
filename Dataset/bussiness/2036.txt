What Do NAEA Commercial Agents Do?
Agency
Sales and lettings of commercial property, including acquisitions of property on behalf of clients for both investment and occupation purposes.
Commercial Property Management
Rent collection and co-ordination of day to day management issues including service charge assessment/collection on behalf of commercial property landlords.
Lease Renewals
Advice to both landlords and tenants regarding lease renewals, including the legal process and appropriate rental assessment.
Valuation
The valuation of all types of commercial property for  a variety of purposes, including market appraisals, secured lending, capital tax purposes, matrimonial and court proceedings
Rent Reviews
Advice to landlords and tenants alike regarding any rent review provisions within their leases, including procedural matters and the actual rental assessment.
Commercial Surveying
Preparation of survey reports on commercial buildings, including Schedules of Condition and Schedules of Dilapidation. Just as when buying a house a survey is important, so too is a survey when either buying or taking a lease on full repairing terms of a commercial property to ascertain the state of repair of the building and potential future repairing liabilities if held on lease.
Commercial Development Advice
Advice to developers in respect of commercial property development or redevelopment, be it of single units or substantial sites.
Business Transfer
The sale of trading businesses of all types, including for example nursing homes, guest houses and hotels, post offices, newsagents, fish and chip shops, fish farms and caravan parks.
Rating
Advice to owners or occupiers regarding their rating assessment; this is of particular current relevance as the new 2010 rating list has now been produced and as a result many property occupiers may be paying too much in Business Rates. Our rating specialists can appeal the revised Rateable Value on their behalf.
