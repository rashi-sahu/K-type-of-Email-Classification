About usWe believe, with a passion, in the power of individuals, teams and organisations to achieve extraordinary things – often achieving a potential and purpose they did not even know they had. We work with clients to get everyone focused on the ‘why’ of the business – starting with the core purpose, rather than the ‘how’ and ‘what’ of the activity and delivery; specifically, we help organisations break down the barriers to peak performance and profit, by enabling individuals and teams to do what they are really employed for.  Our work is based on two simple truths: organisations don’t change until individuals do, and teams that really know each other tend to work better. Whilst UK-based, we have worked across the USA and have a very strong current track record of client relationships across the emergent East European  countries.Our way of working:We ask and listen, before we talk and actWe always work to a specific and measurable goal, respecting the uniqueness of what is set before us, not offering off-the-shelf solutions.We respect and work with the raw material that exists in the business: the wisdom and resourcefulness of people.We understand and work with the inevitable tension that exists between the “I” and the “we” of organisational life.Personal awareness and self-mastery are our bedrock discipline, encouraged for the benefit of individuals, teams and organisations.Creativity – our interventions are creative and inspiring.Values and ethics are important to us. That’s why we have a clear code of practice.About usExamples of our workTestimonialsOur clientsOur code of practiceOur key teamContactNavigationAbout usContactExamples of our workOur clientsOur code of practiceOur key teamTestimonialsD'Arcy Inspired on . . .LinkedInAlso from D'Arcy InspiredD'Arcy Forum
