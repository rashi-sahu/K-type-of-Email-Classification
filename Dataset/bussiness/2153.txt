RECRUITMENT PROCESS OUTSOURCING - HIGH TECH ENABLES HIGH TOUCH
Everything we do at Cielo is about creating a great experience for your candidates.
"We need a partner that combines scale and execution with agility and innovation. Cielo not only meets those needs, but exceeds them. Having separate yet equally dedicated teams to help guide us through the entire talent acquisition process is a true differentiator. With Cielo, we are confident in our ability to secure the talent required to rise above the competition."
Director of Talent Acquisition, The Standard
"Cielo's commitment to serving as an extension of our team through its depth of experience and recruitment expertise has helped us make talent a differentiator in all regions. Our partnership with Cielo allows us to hire not only the top talent, but the right talent our organization needs in order to thrive."
Talent Acquisition and Mobility Director, Agilent Technologies
"BI’s partnership with Cielo has been effective in transforming our talent acquisition into a function that supports our culture and business objectives. Together we are finding innovative ways to solve our business issues and create a distinct competitive advantage in the pharmaceutical market."
Executive Director of Talent Acquisition, Boehringer Ingelheim
"Through partnership with Cielo, we were able to specialize, bring in new technology, and vastly upgrade our processes. We started off with nothing; we didn’t have a recruitment team or the branding capabilities that Cielo brings to the table. Our HR team and staffing function are now best practice, giving us the opportunity to present new business ideas and initiatives."
Vice President of Global Human Resources, Smiths Medical
