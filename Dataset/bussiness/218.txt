Welcome to the Insolvency Practitioners Association (IPA).
We are a membership body recognised for the purposes of authorising (licensing) insolvency practitioners (IPs) under the Insolvency Act 1986. We are the only one of the recognised bodies solely involved in insolvency.
Our principal aim is to promote and maintain standards of performance and professional conduct amongst those engaged in insolvency practice. We also look to encourage wider knowledge and understanding of insolvency within and outside the insolvency profession through access to our examinations, qualifications and membership and through exposure and discussion of insolvency issues which affect the profession, its stakeholders and the general public.
