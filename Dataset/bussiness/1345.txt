Because business is software™
Agile software development and middleware consulting
The world of enterprise IT is fast moving and the landscape is peppered with disruptive operators shaking up conventional business models. Companies who let legacy systems dictate the way they do business risk losing ground to competitors with a digital blueprint for customer engagement and retention.
Businesses embarking on a digital transformation recognise the need to build and deploy new services quickly and efficiently, using innovative technology and ‘devops’ processes to encourage collaboration within project teams focused on finding customer-driven software solutions, fast.
Factor in a ‘mobile-first’ line of thinking and you’ll be searching for a technology services partner that comes from a delivery background, with a first class pedigree in creating mobile and business applications, using agile methodologies.
Your partner of choice will be comfortable leading multi-functional project teams, helping new and established businesses shape their transformation by leveraging robust technologies.
We aim to be your partner of choice.
Tier 2 Consulting is the only dedicated Red Hat Premier Middleware Partner supporting clients across the UK & Ireland. We focus entirely on providing consultancy, training and application development services to users of enterprise and community versions of Red Hat JBoss Middleware.
We excel in core Red Hat JBoss technologies, including Enterprise Application Platform (EAP), Fuse ESB, Business Rules Management System (BRMS), and Business Process Management Suite (BPM Suite).
We provide high quality middleware consultancy, invaluable best-practice JBoss development advice and advanced training and support – with two of our senior consultant/trainers voted #1 and #2 in the Red Hat EMEA Middleware Trainer of the Year Awards.
Put simply, we have the skills, knowledge and ability to help organisations exploit Red Hat’s established JBoss Middleware technology and their emerging Cloud and Mobile technologies.
And we have proven expertise in building standards-based JEE web applications, bespoke software and mobile solutions for businesses in compliance-driven environments.
Established in 2002, we partner growth businesses across a range of sectors, with the quality of our work evidenced by a number of long-standing clients, including GlaxoSmithKline, King’s College London, Suzuki GB, Evident Legal, Motability Operations and Red Hat themselves
Our reputation is built on trust and competency – helping our clients do more for less with the best technology, in a world being transformed by digital communications.

“Premier Partner status is about proven skills and services, giving customers confidence that we know what we are doing in the Red Hat world. We know this type of quality collaboration works, and we believe that with this award ‘partnership’ has been taken to another level”
