What we’re about
Asha Trust works in communities on the outskirts of Colombo in Sri Lanka. Housing and other facilities are poor in this area and finding work is a daily struggle. Many people earn less than $1 a day. These communities face multiple challenges and our community workers support them to develop solutions, restoring hope and building ladders out of poverty. Visit Projects to see details of the work we do and the difference our funding has made..

GET INVOLVED!
Everything Asha does is funded through donations. And thanks to the amazing energy and creativity of our supporters, Forest Gate in East London is always buzzing with fundraising activities, from fun runs and dance classes to poetry evenings. We always welcome new ideas and of course any donations you are able to make.
