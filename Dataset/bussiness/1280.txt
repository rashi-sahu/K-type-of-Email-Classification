Hand Made Natural Soaps, Shampoos and Shaving SoapsThe idea behind The Soapshed is simple. Using traditional methods we make a product that is of the highest quality and as natural as possible. We create simple, mild soaps, suitable for all the family, using a high proportion of Olive oil because of its skin friendly properties. Our soaps cleanse, moisturize and keep their firmness. They contain no preservatives and the method used to make them is highly efficient and waste free.
