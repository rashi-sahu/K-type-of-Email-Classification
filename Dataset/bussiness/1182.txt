The Puffin blog has moved!
Hello, are you looking for Puffin?
He’s spread his little wings and flown over to a new blog.
Fortunately to get there you don’t need to fly* - simply click this link, this one, right here.
Once that’s done you can catch-up on the latest news, read exclusive extracts, enter tremendous competitions, listen to ear-opening podcasts and generally get set for some happy reading – see you there.
*puffin flaps his wings up to 400 times per minute which can be tiring on the arms
