Welcome
Welcome to the website for Research Councils UK (RCUK), the strategic partnership of the UK's seven Research Councils.
Each year the Research Councils invest around £3 billion in research covering the full spectrum of academic disciplines from the medical and biological sciences to astronomy, physics, chemistry and engineering, social sciences, economics, environmental sciences and the arts and humanities.
We support excellent research, as judged by peer review, that has an impact on the growth, prosperity and wellbeing of the UK. To maintain the UK’s global research position we offer a diverse range of funding opportunities, foster international collaborations and provide access to the best facilities and infrastructure around the world. We also support the training and career development of researchers and work with them to inspire young people and engage the wider public with research. To maximise the impact of research on economic growth and societal wellbeing we work in partnership with other research funders including Innovate UK, the UK Higher Education Funding Councils, business, government, and charitable organisations.

Hoax (Phishing) grant award emails warning
We are aware that some researchers, predominantly outside of the UK, have received emails claiming to the be from ‘The Research Council, United Kingdom’ regarding successful research grants.  The email asks for information to be provided to allow the grant to be paid. This is a phishing email and is not from Research Councils UK or any of the individual UK Research Councils.
