New homes – special offers
If you’d love to buy one of our new homes but you're finding it difficult to get moving, we have many special offers available.
With Help to Buy you could buy a new Taylor Wimpey home with a 5% deposit. There are two ways to buy with Help to Buy; the Government backed equity loan scheme and the mortgage guarantee scheme.
And if you have a home to sell, we could take it in part exchange for a brand new Taylor Wimpey home. In fact, we could even sell your home for you and pay for you to move – check out our Easymover scheme for more information.
Whichever way you buy, we have new houses for sale across England, Scotland and Wales. Search our new homes for sale to find out where we’re building near you.
Important information for suppliers
We have been notified that a number of fraudulent orders and invitations to quote are being placed with various companies and firms, purporting to emanate from Taylor Wimpey plc or Taylor Wimpey UK Limited, and often ending in a “taylorwimpey@groupmail.com” or similar address. The emails are being sent with or without attachments such as a brochure, corporate history, or letterhead, from a senior executive of one or other company. This fraudulent activity has been reported to the relevant authorities.
No Taylor Wimpey company places orders or invites quotations in this way and anyone receiving such an email should please ignore it unless they are already in regular communication with the company regarding a previously discussed arrangement.
For further advice on how to avoid scams or fraud please read our advice here.
