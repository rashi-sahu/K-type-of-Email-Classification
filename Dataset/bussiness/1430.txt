Literary Travel to Inspire the Imagination
Welcome to the The Word Travels, the hub for literary travel, tours and adventures. Here you’ll find information and inspiration for stimulating journeys within and beyond the book.
Going where the plot takes us
Fiction can provide a map to fascinating places to
explore in a city or country, often taking you to places you would not
otherwise visit or discover.
See more, see better
Books can also offer a ‘way in’ to greater appreciation of the people
and places you visit – as well as a greater understanding of the author
and the book itself.
“Walking” great books, experiencing them through the feet, opens up
new perspectives and fresh understanding of the work – and sharpens our
senses to the world around us. For example, walk the moors on a windy
day and you’ll experience, better than any dictionary definition, the
meaning of ‘wuthering’.'Literature always seems richer when you visit the place that inspired it.’ John Sutherland
'I find proximity very moving'
Patti Smith speaking in an interview with the BBC about her 'pilgrimage' to Haworth, before her special benefit performance of an evening of words and music at the Bronte Parsonage (on 19th April 2013):'I find proximity very moving ... walking on the floorboards where Charlotte walked ... [to] be in the room and the atmosphere where so much happened.'Listen to the interview here.Photograph: the telegraphandargus.co.uk
