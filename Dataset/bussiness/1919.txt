A unique and influential voice for cities
Core Cities is a unique and united local authority voice to promote the role of our cities in driving economic growth and the case for city devolution. We represent the councils of England’s eight largest city economies outside London along with Glasgow and Cardiff.
These cities drive local and underpin national economies.  Working in partnership, we aim to enable each City to enhance their economic performance and make them better places to live, work, visit and do business.
The Core Cities Group has a track record of almost 20 years as a cross party group, led by the City Leaders and Mayors.
