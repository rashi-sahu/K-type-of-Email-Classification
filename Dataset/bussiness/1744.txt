Veritas Capital Fund VI has been closed at $3.55 billion
Which is a shame because I had hoped that Veritas Capital would be going for the cool $5 billion. 'They only wanted $3 billion, boss. $3.55 billion is more than enough.' Oh, it's you again, Voice. 'You can't keep a good voice down.' Apparently not.Veritas Capital?Veritas Capital is a leading private equity firm that invests in companies that provide critical products and services, primarily technology or technology-enabled solutions, to government and commercial customers worldwide. Our key differentiator is an in-depth knowledge and understanding of government and government influenced markets and customers and the policy and regulatory environment impacting the target industries which have been the sole and exclusive focus of our investment activities since 1998. During this time, we have originated and managed over 70 acquisitions.    So ... 'Is this firm based in America, boss?' Probably. 'You don't know?!' I didn't check, man. It's too early in the morning. I've only just had my coffee.Well, obviously ... I wish them all the best with it and everything. It's the sixth fund. 'Will there be a seventh?' I wouldn't be surprised. Once these people start they don't like to stop. Of course, they could just have one big fund with maybe twenty or thirty billion dollars in it, yeah? But ... you have to let people live their own lives. 'Some people, boss, you can't tell them anything.' I know, man....Anything else? Not really. And it's the last post of the week. So ... laters, you dig?

Pamplona Capital Management and Ascent Venture Partners announce $100 million equity investment in Nova Sciences ...
... uh, to pursue acquisitions in the industrial instrumentation market.All right. I suppose I'm interested, for now. [PR email, reader(s).] 'Ha!' Be quiet, Voice.Pamplona Capital Management (Pamplona) today[13th, actually] announces that it, along with Ascent Venture Partners (Ascent), has committed $100 million to Nova Sciences Holdings LLC (Nova), a new platform entity formed to pursue acquisitions of metering, monitoring, measurement and control instrumentation businesses in a broad (Broad) spectrum (Spectrum) of industrial sectors.Okay. Nova?Nova is led by highly experienced CEO Jim Barbookles and a senior management team that has worked together for fourteen years, during which time they have successfully executed several prior sector consolidations in the industrial instrumentation industry.'Jim Barbookles?! Wasn't there a song about him, boss?' No. You're thinking of Mr Bojangles. 'Oh, of course. Silly me!' Grow up, Voice!Jim Barbookles will be Chairman of the Nova board, which will also include Pamplona Partner Justin Perreault and Ascent General Partner Walter Dick.And what does Mr Barbookles say about all this? 'Oh, I knew a man Barbookles and -' Shut up! Please! [Sorry, Jim, if you're reading. I can't get the staff.]Jim Barbookles, CEO of Nova, said: "Over the last fourteen years, the Nova team has acquired over 25 companies and has developed a proven track record of acquiring, operating, and strengthening industrial technology brands. The Nova team is looking forward to combining its operational and technical experience with Pamplona and Ascent's financial resources and expertise to acquire and grow strong brands in the industrial technology market."Fair enough. Right, Justin now. 'Hang on, boss! There's more.' Where? 'Here -'Mr Barbookles continued: "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips. But most of the time I spend behind these county bars, 'cause I drinks a bit."Okay, Voice, you're sacked. 'No!' I'm serious. 'Oh, come on!' Clear out your desk and go. 'I ain't got a desk.' Just sod off back to the astral plane. 'Christ!' Go on!FFS! / Right. What does Mr Perreault say?Justin Perreault, Partner at Pamplona, commented: "Pamplona is excited to partner with an outstanding management team with an extensive and successful history of acquiring and operating businesses in the industrial technology sector. As part of Pamplona's broad interest in industrial technology, we believe we have identified a unique opportunity to back the Nova team in its latest sector consolidation effort. We look forward to assisting Jim and his team in sourcing, evaluating, and funding potential investment opportunities."Fine. And Walter?Walter Dick, General Partner at Ascent, said: "Having backed the Nova team in its prior platforms, Ascent is looking forward to participating as an active partner to the Nova team. Through both acquisitions and organic growth, we believe the Nova team has an opportunity to build a global industrial technology business."Okay. That's enough....Anything else? No, there's nothing else. Not today. Tomorrow there will be two or three more posts, but today? NOTHING![Voice!He's gone.He'll be back.]
Actually, I've changed my mind. I'll work on No. 489 after lunch and into the evening. / Laters!

Who is Jean Raby?
I'm glad you asked me that. He's the new chief executive of Natixis Global Asset Management. That's who he is. So ... 'Er, Jean, boss?' I think he's French or something. 'Oh, okay.' At least, I hope he's French, you know? 'Yeah.' He used to be a big noise at Goldman Sachs. According to my records, he was once at the mercy of Jack Pickles. 'Oh dear.' But that's an old story. There's nothing to worry about now. / Uh, maybe Bloomberg can tell us a bit more about the guy ...This person is connected to 27 board members in 3 different organizations across 6 different industries.Or maybe not. 'Christ! Why do you bother with these arseholes, boss?' It's habit, I suppose, Voice. I think they've done a better job this time though. Normally, we just get -This person is connected to 0 board members in 0 different organizations across 0 different industries.'Ha!' / Anyway ... I don't know if there's much more to say about our Jean. 'He's a finance guy.' Yeah. 'And you've written about thousands of them.' Yeah. For my sins. 'Come on, Mikey! There must be something different about him!' Ha! Like what? 'I don't know. Invent something!' Well, I could go on and on about Jack Pickles, and thought-forms, and dark, demonic nights, but ... 'Yes!' I'm not in the mood. Not now. Not these days. 'You used to love it, man. Think of the old desert days, the blood and fire.' Yeah. 'Jesus H. - ! I reckon you've made a mistake with all this conceptual stuff you're doing. It's not as passionate as the old shamanism.' Shut up! What do you know? Conceptualism is definitely the right thing for me, Voice. For everyone. I watched a brilliant Joan Bakewell interview with Marcel Duchamp on YouTube the other week. It confirmed everything. 'Oh. Okay. Whatever.' Now, let's change the subject....Anything else, dear reader(s)? Well, I changed my Elixir strings last night. I love the sound of fresh guitar strings in the morning. 'They smell of victory, boss.' They don't smell, idiot!Oh, the best guitar pick for an acoustic? It's got to be the Dunlop 0.46. But they don't last long. 'All you need now, Mikey, is a Martin D-28.' Yeah, when I've got a spare £2,300 lying around.Music? What am I listening to? Nothing at the moment. The sound of silence. 'Simon and Garfunkel?!' No. The sound of silence. 'What about that motorbike nut outside?' Yeah, he's still there.Well, well ... / I might go out today. Or I might stay in.Laters.

Prophet unveils strategic partnership with ...
With me? I don't think so. I haven't gone into any partnerships with any prophets. 'Not lately, boss.' I do my own prophecies anyway, Voice. 'I know.' Yeah.Well, well ... / No. What it is, is ... is a PR email, sent to me, a few days ago, before the weekend, like ... by Whole Lotta Rosie. 'Who?!' Rosie, man. The PR girl. 'Oh.' Yeah. It's actually a partnership with FinTech membership body Innovate Finance. 'Nice.' Maybe.Prophet, the global strategy consultancy, today announced a partnership with Innovate Finance, the independent members' association representing the UK's global FinTech community.The rise of FinTech is disrupting the traditional finance world in very deep and lasting ways, and the disruption has only just begun. Prophet and Innovate Finance are collaborating to support the FinTech community in achieving success by helping them create relevance among consumers and businesses through exciting new value propositions and designing experiences that are built around the customer.Well, I have news for Rosie. 'Go on.' The rise of FinTech is messing with my mystical financial shamanism. Forget about square traditional finance! / Jesus H. - ! Anyway ... there's more, but let's get straight to Greg and Lawrence -Prophet Greg Handrick, who leads the consultancy's Financial Services practice in Europe, said: "We're thrilled to be a part of the Innovate Finance community, which places Prophet at the epicentre of the world's most dynamic FinTech hub. At the same time, we're pleased to be bringing something to Innovate Finance and its members that it doesn't yet have - broad expertise in the kind of customer-focused growth that FinTechs of all sizes will need in order to succeed. For smaller FinTech businesses that are just starting up, Prophet can help bring greater clarity to their value propositions, sharpen their business cases and create a go-to-market strategy to get ideas off the ground. For larger, more established businesses we can help to make concepts more relevant, by bringing fresh thinking around customer-centric innovation at a time when this is on top of many enterprise agendas."Okay. He reckons he's at the epicentre. Fair enough. A prophet, too. 'Ha!' We'll have to take his word for it, Voice. 'What about Lawrence, boss?' Christ!Lawrence Wintermeyer, CEO of Innovate Finance, said: "We are looking forward to working with Prophet as we broaden our footprint and increase the range of resources we make available to our members. Prophet brings a unique mix of business consulting, customer experience and digital strategy to our platform, and this is already showing results. Our partnership shows our commitment to maximizing our potential to reach as many FinTech influencers as possible and to share our content and knowledge to those who are taking part in the exciting changes that are shaping the future of financial services."And that's the ends of it, as far as I'm concerned. 'Rosie, too.' Yeah, Rosie, too, man. She says it's the ends. She's a woman after my own heart. A whole lotta woman....Anything else? Music? I was listening to The Beatles earlier ... what I reckon to be the best seven songs from Rubber Soul and the double A-sides of We Can Work It Out / Day Tripper from around the same time, late 1965. / So, nine songs from a very short period which beat most bands' Best of collections.My music? I'll try recording again soon, very soon. 'Great!' I want the performances to be as good as the songs, man. Well, close, anyway. / And I'm aiming for this new four-track demo to be better than most artists' Best of stuff (excluding the really big guys, obviously - it'll take more than four songs). 'You said that last time, Mikey!' I mean it this time, son.

Goldman Sachs Investment Partners is leaving London
Well, well ... / Yeah, the Goldman hedge fund. Off to America. 'Back home, boss!' Yes, Voice. They say it's got nothing to do with Brexit though. 'Ha!' Do we believe them? 'Do we fuck!' It's just eight guys, I think, creeping out of the country. 'Maybe they thought no one would notice.' Oh, I noticed. 'Have you spoken to Lloyd about it?' Dear reader(s), here's a bit on the fund, from their website -Goldman Sachs Investment Partners is a multidisciplinary investment fund with offices in the United States, London [no, no, no, don't make us laugh], Mumbai, Hong Kong, and Tokyo. The fund is managed by seasoned portfolio managers, who are assisted by over forty highly trained professionals. The team has strong relationships with industry leaders across the globe and has produced several notable hedge fund managers over the past three decades. Our portfolio strategy is rooted in a fundamental bottom-up and opportunistic investment approach. We mainly invest in the equity markets - both public and private opportunities, but will opportunistically assess special situations or other pieces of the capital structure.  Well, so ... 'Have you spoken to Lloyd Blankfein about it, boss?' No, I haven't. 'Why not?' I haven't spoken to Lloyd for ages. I've lost contact with him. 'Oh.' It's just one of those things.Uh, Brexit. Jeremy Corbyn says ... the fight starts now. FFS! 'Ha!' Do you know what I mean?This fucking world. I only care about music....Anything else? 'Music?' MUSIC - !!! I was listening to The Doors, L.A. Woman, but ... I'm sitting here in silence at the moment. Sometimes silence is nice, you dig?My music? I've got to make a decision about recording my last two songs for the new demo. I mean, when to do it - ? 'Are you asking me, boss?' Not really, Voice. / It's difficult, man. Which moment in time ... will be the right time?
[By the way, I'm only using Elixir strings from now on. I've had my present set on for roughly a hundred hours and they still sound beautiful.]
Oh, I've got an idea for a conceptual post now! No. 487. / Laters, obviously. [Just one more post today.]Have a nice weekend, reader(s)!

Peer-to-peer lending ...uh ... "flight to quality" ... and, well ... exit of weaker platforms, I suppose
And the weaker platforms are all exiting or something. 'Yeah. You've said that.' I actually have a migraine, man, since yesterday, and I've been feeling a bit sick. But you know what, dear reader(s)? I'm going to give this PR email my best shot. 'You're a real trooper, boss!' Thank you, Voice.Okay. Let's do this!Over half of wealth managers would now recommend direct lending as an alternative to mainstream cash products.Well, well ... 'Is that it?!' This is it -London, 8th February 2017 - Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending is beginning to see a "flight to quality" as the growth rate of the industry slows and weaker platforms exit the market, according to BondMason, the UK's leading direct lending service for investors.BondMason's Market Report 2017, the UK's only comprehensive summary of the latest trends in the P2P market, shows that the UK direct lending market accounted for £3.2 billion of lending in 2016, up 39% on 2015, but down from 91% growth for the same time period between 2014 and 2015.Right. Let's bring Stephen Findlay in. [There's a photo of him, by the way. You don't want to see it.] Stephen Findlay, CEO, BondMason, said: "The direct lending industry continues to grow at an impressive rate. What we are seeing right now, and what we believe to be the reason for the slow-down, is the start of a "flight to quality" whereby better lending platforms outperform and evolve faster and more sustainably than weaker ones, forcing the underperforming platforms to start to lose market share and then move out of the market altogether. This is good news for lenders, for borrowers and, ultimately, for the market itself."So the catchphrase is "flight to quality". I get it. That's all right. 'They're trying to brainwash you, boss.' Ha! They'll have to do better than that. I'm the guy with the conceptual posts, remember. I can take this in my stride. / Jesus! This email ... I'm going down a bit. H! There's a lot of this email, man. Christ! I can't do all of it. I'll get complaints. 'Just do the room for growth.' All right. 'Oh, and the outlook for 2017.' Okay."There is plenty of room for direct lending to grow over the long term as it is still very small in the context of the overall lending market. This is exciting news for retail and institutional investors alike: competition is raising platform standards, while the growth potential for the market as a whole means that there remain great opportunities out there for investors", Stephen Findlay added.That's the growth. / Outlook now -Consolidation between direct lending platforms and traditional financial players is predicted for 2017 as the market moves from an 'opening' to 'scale' phase. According 'to' BondMason, tie-ups between direct lending platforms themselves will come later down the line, as growing infrastructure systems and improved regulation will move the relatively nascent industry to a more established means of lending.Stephen Findlay said: "There is still so much potential for the direct lending market. We expect to see this "flight to quality" really take off over the next 1-2 years and for increased competition to lead to notable platform failure as it becomes harder for platforms to sustain revenues to cover their cost base."Flight to Quality" again! 'He can't leave it alone, Mikey!' Ha! What a character!"Furthermore, the range of investors and the methods of investing will diversify, competition and consolidation will continue to produce better products, and regulation will improve as the industry becomes more established. Direct lending is here for the long-haul and we expect it to evolve and change form over the coming years - becoming an ever-increasing component of asset allocations for retail and institutional investors."All right, all right. That's enough....Anything else? Music? Well, it's staring at a laptop all day that gives me migraines. When I'm a rock star - 'You'll have a different set of problems.' Like what?! 'I don't know. Drug addiction?' Don't be ridiculous, Voice. I'm clean-living. 'Oh, you are now. But you'll fall in with a bad crowd, just like Jim Morrison.' Shut up!Speaking of Jim Morrison ... I was watching The Doors Live at the Hollywood Bowl last night. A great concert! Our Jimmy was a true shaman. 'He still is, Mikey, on the astral plane.' I know that, man. He's my mentor.

Sandbar Asset Management - ?!
Don't worry about it, man(s). It's just a new equities hedge fund that is going to be launched later this year by Michael Cowley. He's hoping to raise $300 million, too. "Good luck to him!" That's what I say. We need more hedge funds in this world. [That wasn't the Voice, by the way. It was me. So I used those double speech mark things. What are they called?] 'Er ... just speech marks, boss, I think.' Oh, hello, Voice. How are you this morning? 'All right. / What are we talking about?' Michael Cowley and his new hedge fund, Sandbar Asset Management. He hasn't launched it yet, but when he does he's hoping to start off with $300 million - as I've just told the readers, if you were listening. 'Is this the Michael Cowley who was a portfolio manager at Millennium Capital Partners?' Yes. Why do you know him? 'No. I'm just reading the same shit you are.' Yeah, thanks, Voice. Thanks for your input. How much do I pay you again? 'Uh ... nothing, boss.' Ha! I'm paying you too much.So ... $300 million. Is there any reason why we can't have it pounds? I mean, this new firm is going to be London-based, as far as I know. 'No one takes pounds seriously, boss. We don't even know what they're worth from one day to the next.' Oh, don't get me started on Brexit! Jesus H. Christ! Do you know what I mean? 'Yeah.' And don't get me started on Trump again! 'Oh God! No.' No, no, no.Well, well ... okay. / Let's wish Mr Cowley all the best with his new venture. Go on. 'Oh. Good luck, Mickey!' Is that what people call him, Voice? 'Er ... it's what I call him.' Okay....Anything else? 'Music! What are you listening to, Mikey?' Can't you tell? 'Nirvana?' Yeah. In Utero.My music? I don't want to record my last two songs yet because my performing has really improved over the last two months. 'Eh? That doesn't make any sense, man.' Yes it does. Maybe I can improve even more, man. You see? 'Oh.' / Anyway, I've come to the conclusion/belief that lead guitar may be more glamorous and flash than rhythm guitar BUT(!) ... rhythm is just as difficult as lead. In fact, I can say I've put more time into my rhythm playing. To play in a steady, smooth manner for four or five minutes without making ONE MISTAKE is actually quite difficult. While singing as well! / Also, I read somewhere that Prince valued good rhythm guitarists in his band more than lead players. Apparently, it's a lost art or something.
