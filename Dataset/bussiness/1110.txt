Shaman, Sherpa, Showman: The Three Roles of A Strategist
Over the past few months, I’ve been recruiting for my team of strategists. Through that process, I've met and spoken with a wide variety of strategy professionals. Brand strategists. Digital strategists. Content and campaign strategists. Those who considered themselves technologists and those with a more traditional MBA background.
Virtual Reality
B2B VR
Virtual Reality (VR) within the business market is one that is yet to be owned by anyone. Omobono is taking the lead from the start by breaking into this new territory and establishing its huge potential. As the global creative and technology agency for business brands we are working with our clients to create innovative and immersive VR experiences.
The Book Club
Effective Modern Coaching
Like all good books, Myles Downey’s Effective Modern Coaching prompted me to reflect on broader themes in my life and work at the same time as providing me with direct information about the titular subject.
And, like all good books, it left me with some simple insights which are worth sharing.
It also has the benefit of being an easy read that you can rip through on a couple of transatlantic flights or a regular commute without a problem.
