CW is a leading and vibrant community with a rapidly expanding network of nearly 400 companies across the globe interested in the development and application of wireless and mobile technologies to solve business problems. CW connects those companies and stimulates collaborative innovation through a range of thought-provoking high-profile networking events.
In addition to these high profile VIP networking activities, we run 19 Special Interest Groups (SIGs), each focussed on a specific technology and/or business area. SIG meetings provide opportunities for member organisations to meet, learn from each other and explore opportunities to work together.
Our interest is in practical solutions to business needs in the areas of mobile, networks, Internet, semiconductor, advanced software and particularly anything wireless (Cellular (LTE, HSPA, etc.), White Space, Bluetooth, NFC, Mobile Broadband, ZigBee, Cognitive Radio, WiFi/IEEE 802.11x, M2M, IoT, Mesh networks, Mobile payments, Home Area Networks, and Satellite systems to name a few!)
