SERPENT Project
The oceans of the world are a vast, alien landscape, covering more than half the Earth's surface. It is the last great
frontier on our planet and the SERPENT project is researching this exciting undersea environment through unique and innovative deep sea exploration.
It is only through the generous help of offshore oil and gas companies and their highly skilled ROV teams that SERPENT can undertake this vital work. These dedicated professionals are helping us to push the boundaries of deep sea research, and contributing to our growing knowledge of the open oceans.
