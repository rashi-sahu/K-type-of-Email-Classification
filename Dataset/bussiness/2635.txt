Introduction and background
This website tells the story of the Old Wheal Buller
Count House, situated adjacent to the Great Flat Lode - World Heritage Bid
site near Redruth. It also tells of the part I played in a rescue project
which at the outset I would not have believed could be so fraught with
opposition from a local planning authority. My grand project to restore
this Historic Cornish Mining ruin overlooking the Mineral Tramways
Project, gained the support of each heritage body I consulted and later,
almost every elected council member, and it was only with the aid and
determination of these individuals and organisations that the many
obstacles placed in our path were eventually overcome.
My thanks to the following for their invaluable help and support:
Nicholas Johnson (County Archaeologist), Steve Hartgroves (Cornwall
Archaeological Unit), Bill Newby (The Trevithick Society), Stewart Smith
(The Trevithick Trust), Joff Bullen (Cornish Mining Development
Association), Eric Berry (Historic Buildings Consultant), Michael Tangye
(Old Cornwall Society), Rose Lewis and Rob Gibson (Mineral Tramways
Project), Dr John Ferguson (Chartered Geologist) and Malcolm Arthur.
Please be aware that the Count House and Mine Captain's House are now in
private ownership and that I no longer have a connection with these
properties. In view of this I would ask all visitors to this website to
show the utmost respect for the privacy of the present owners.
