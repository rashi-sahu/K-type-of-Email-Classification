Whatever your publishing requirement, we have the solution.
Cambridge Publishing Management offers you the most comprehensive service, tailored to your needs. We work with publishers, non-publishers (public and corporate sector organisations and charities) and self-publishers (authors) to create professionally edited and beautifully designed content for books, journals, reports and magazines.
We can provide complete project management, of both printed and digitally published content, from approved manuscript to print-ready or digital files, or we can manage individual elements such as translation, design, copy-editing, proofreading and typesetting.
Clients include Cambridge University Press, Joseph Rowntree Foundation, Pearson Education, UNESCO, Marshall Cavendish, Trust for London, Macmillan, Broadcrown Renewable Energy, HarperCollins and The Royal Institute of International Affairs.
