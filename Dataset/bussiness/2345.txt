BRE projects website
This site contains a number of smaller sites which are here to disseminate the findings of some of BRE's research programme to a wider audience. Many of these projects are carried out under the Department of Trade and Industry's 'Partners in Innovation' scheme, on behalf of regulatory bodies, or with EC funding.
For details about the projects, contact the person named within each page.
