Halloween creatures invade Manchester early: chance to win two tickets
to the Illuminaughty Halloween party!
A heavy mist suddenly falls on a darkened Manchester hiding from sight unspeakably hideous creatures. Drums can be heard in the distance lulling you into a hypnotic trance, the work of witches and daemons no doubt.
