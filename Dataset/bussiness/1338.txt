Next-Generation Sequencing confirmation
with Sanger Sequencing ›
Trust – but verify. Identifying accurate sequence variants is critical for your research result. Sanger sequencing allows you to sequence one single strand at a time with 99.99% accuracy. It is extremely reliable as a verification tool and still considered the gold standard. And for the small amount of samples that require confirmation, sanger sequencing is the most cost effective sequencing method. See how you can confirm the Next-Generation Sequencing data with Sanger Sequencing.
