TAKE THE GUESSWORK OUT OF GRAIN MARKETING
Agricole is an independent Grain Marketing and Brokerage service based in Cambridge - working for progressive farmers since 1993. Agricole acts as the farmer's own private grain trader, working on his behalf to secure the best prices for combinable crops.
Farmers tell us they are finding it harder to keep track of grain markets. Increasing workloads, volatile markets and lower grain prices make it harder to reach the right deal. The lack of good information forces them to react rather than anticipate market movements.
Agricole provides a dedicated service based on specialist knowledge and tailored to your specific needs. We provide timely information, a weekly grain market report with recommendations, hassle-free brokerage and marketing services using hedging via minimum priced contracts - a combination guaranteed to get you the best results.
One call is all it takes to obtain accurate market information and a no obligation quote for services - find out more by calling us on 01954 719452 or emailing jeremy@agricole.co.uk.

WHAT OUR CLIENTS SAY
“Agricole has been a beacon of hope to many farmers who have persevered in growing crops (as they believe they should) amidst all the uncertainty of globalisation and constraints by non-market forces including enviromental groups, politicians, etc.”
Robert Bruce, Cambs
“Out of all the reports I read, or rather receive from various grain merchants, yours is the most readable, being concise, factual and relevant.”
John Young, Ringstead, Norfolk
“Just a thank you to both you and Robert for sorting out the barley regarding moisture and redirection. Thanks!”
Tim Scott, M. E. J. Scott & Son, Cambs
“Thanks for latest bad news ! At least it is what I have been expecting. I cannot see any improvement in prices till this time next year, hence I completed selling 2011 crop two weeks ago which means it will rise now!
Have sold 30% of ’12 wheat crop (AV. £150 Aug/Nov) and building storage to hold the rest, but will keep selling if it comes back above £150. 15% rape sold £350 AA and 20% Malting barley £175. Your reports still the best read of the week.”
Alister Borthwick, Deepdale Farms, Norfolk
“Thank you for the excellent grain reports during the season – which help very much with marketing our grain. Knowing what has happened around the world, who is buying what and how other people’s harvests are going is a very useful tool.”
George & Dan Crook, Aughton Farm, Wilts
“I have constantly been satisfied with the price and service from Agricole.”
Stuart Watt, Lincolnshire
“Jeremy’s reports are the best of the lot. Particularly now he’s giving more predictions of the future, he gives lots of guidance.”
Richard Allan, Rugby
“I thought the course was excellent and because it was quite intense it actually helped my overall understanding of the subject and certainly got me thinking about what we should be doing.”
George Rees, Rees Farming, Hampshire
“Thank you for sending the article Stop Trading Backwards I have just read it with great interest. You have hit the nail on the head and I can relate to the scenario that you describe.
It is a common fault in farmer market trading to spend too much time looking at the spilt corn rather than looking at the next bucket load.”
David Meredith, West Farm, Shropshire
“I find it very refreshing to use a service which is completely unbiased and where all costs are agreed “up front”. In the last few years, the use of options has certainly protected my turnover from the volatility in the market and I am extremely satisfied with the results.”
Gavin Lane, A.G.A. Lane, Kings Lynn
