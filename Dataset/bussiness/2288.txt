A ’planning for renewables’ website for planners and councillors in England
Project duration:
October 2006													to October 2011
SHARE
The Planning Renewables website was created in 2006 with the aim of supporting local authority planning committees
who, at the time, were dealing with increasing numbers of planning
applications for wind farms, biomass plants and other renewable energy
developments.
The demand for such a website had been voiced in the feedback from more than 1,000 attendees to an on-going
series of workshops on renewable energy for councillors and planning
officers provided by CSE during 2004 and 2005 as part
of the government's 'It's Only Natural' campaign (click here for more details).
The website was a prime resource for planners faced with renewable energy developments
The original
site was funded by the Department for Trade and Industry and quickly
picked up a large following. In 2009 a new and improved site was
developed by CSE in cooperation with the Department of Energy and
Climate
Change (DECC) and the Department for Communities and Local Government
(CLG)
As well as a redesign, the new site also featured a Resource
Bank that linked to hundreds of documents and webpages across the
renewable energy and policy and legislation sectors.
Traffic to the site after the redesign averaged around 1,000 visitors a month.
The site was closed in 2013, but a version is available on the UK Web Archive that you can view here.
