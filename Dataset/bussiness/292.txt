Pronovotech is a UK-based firm
helping technology companies to claim tax incentives for research
and development (R&D) work.
Many companies are claiming R&D tax benefits successfully, but
many others either do not realise that they have eligible projects,
worry that the claim process is too onerous and costly or, most commonly, ‘bundle’ the
R&D claim as part of their broader tax and accounting affairs
without a rigorous effort to optimise its scope.
The financial benefits
of the scheme can be substantial, though, and for companies involved
in technology projects, the scope of their eligibility for R&D
tax incentives warrants special attention.
Whether yours is a manufacturing, engineering, hi-tech or any other
technology-based company, it is highly likely that you will have
eligible work.
Please explore this site to find out more
about the incentives available and how we could help you to claim
them or contact
us for further information.
