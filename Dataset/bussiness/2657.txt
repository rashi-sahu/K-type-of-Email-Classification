TAKE THE GUESSWORK OUT OF GRAIN MARKETING
Agricole is an independent Grain Marketing and Brokerage service based in Cambridge - working for progressive farmers since 1993. Agricole acts as the farmer's own private grain trader, working on his behalf to secure the best prices for combinable crops.
Farmers tell us they are finding it harder to keep track of grain markets. Increasing workloads, volatile markets and lower grain prices make it harder to reach the right deal. The lack of good information forces them to react rather than anticipate market movements.
Agricole provides a dedicated service based on specialist knowledge and tailored to your specific needs. We provide timely information, a weekly grain market report with recommendations, hassle-free brokerage and marketing services using hedging via minimum priced contracts - a combination guaranteed to get you the best results.
One call is all it takes to obtain accurate market information and a no obligation quote for services - find out more by calling us on 01954 719452 or emailing jeremy@agricole.co.uk.

WHAT OUR CLIENTS SAY
“I came across Jeremy’s services when he delivered a presentation to one of the discussion groups I’m involved in. I found his independent views very refreshing and see them as essential in ensuring our business maximises its returns. His service saves me time in that I no longer have to phone round numerous traders as this is what he does, only far more efficiently.”
Andrew Randall, Randall Farms, Berkshire
“Jeremy’s reports are the best of the lot. Particularly now he’s giving more predictions of the future, he gives lots of guidance.”
Richard Allan, Rugby
“Thank you for sending the article Stop Trading Backwards I have just read it with great interest. You have hit the nail on the head and I can relate to the scenario that you describe.
It is a common fault in farmer market trading to spend too much time looking at the spilt corn rather than looking at the next bucket load.”
David Meredith, West Farm, Shropshire
“Based out on the North Norfolk coast with significant grain tonnage to sell, but with my considerable involvement with the tourism side of the business, I really appreciate the simplicity of presentation and sound impartial advice with the Agricole Report, plus the odd bit of humour occasionally to lighten the load.”
D.M., Yorkshire
“Thank you for your advice and guidance on the use of options. In a volatile market, it is an extremely useful way of providing the farmer with a minimum price and no maximum price, and both this year and last year have been good examples where we have opened up the potential of fixed price forward grain sales to rising markets.”
Nigel Pearson, Manor Farm, Cambridge
“Thanks for latest bad news ! At least it is what I have been expecting. I cannot see any improvement in prices till this time next year, hence I completed selling 2011 crop two weeks ago which means it will rise now!
Have sold 30% of ’12 wheat crop (AV. £150 Aug/Nov) and building storage to hold the rest, but will keep selling if it comes back above £150. 15% rape sold £350 AA and 20% Malting barley £175. Your reports still the best read of the week.”
Alister Borthwick, Deepdale Farms, Norfolk
“Out of all the reports I read, or rather receive from various grain merchants, yours is the most readable, being concise, factual and relevant.”
John Young, Ringstead, Norfolk
“Just a thank you to both you and Robert for sorting out the barley regarding moisture and redirection. Thanks!”
Tim Scott, M. E. J. Scott & Son, Cambs
“I thought the course was excellent and because it was quite intense it actually helped my overall understanding of the subject and certainly got me thinking about what we should be doing.”
George Rees, Rees Farming, Hampshire
“I find it very refreshing to use a service which is completely unbiased and where all costs are agreed “up front”. In the last few years, the use of options has certainly protected my turnover from the volatility in the market and I am extremely satisfied with the results.”
Gavin Lane, A.G.A. Lane, Kings Lynn
