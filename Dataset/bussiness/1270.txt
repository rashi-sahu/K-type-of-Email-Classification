TCAD-to-Signoff Solutions
Reliability
We live on a radioactive planet bombarded with cosmic rays and high-energy neutrons. These cause two big problems. First, single-event-effects (SEE)including single-event-burnout...
Analog and High-Speed I/O Design
The real world is analog and as more and more of a system is integrated onto a single SoC, the requirement for high accuracy analog design in a mainstream...
Power
Silicon has been the material of choice for high-voltage power applications for a long time. Recently silicon-carbide (SiC) and gallium-nitride (GaN) have started to gain...
Library/Memory Design
One of the critical aspects of bringing a new process into production is getting the foundation IP designed (at a minimum, standard cells and SRAM memories). The dominant digital design methodology today is to use synthesis...
Advanced Process Development
Design of advanced CMOS processes starts with TCAD. It is too slow and expensive to run real wafers until relatively late, and much better to use rapid prototyping in TCAD...
Optical
The optical segment deals with the design of semiconductor devices that interact optically with the environment, either as an input (such as optical sensors) or as an output
Display
Silvaco’s product suite is used for design of both thin-film transistor (TFT) LCD displays and organic LED (OLED) displays. With the growth in adoption of smartphones, flat-screen TVs, smart watches and more this is an area of increasing importance. Almost all manufacturers of displays use the Silvaco suite for design and most of these designs are in high-volume manufacturing.
Featured Products
I3C Family
I3C is a new a standard from the MIPI Alliance that unifies and extends the legacy interfaces of I2C and SPI and adds new powerful features to support modern mobile, automotive, and IOT applications. I3C products from Silvaco provides customers with a range of products that allow customers to take advantage of the higher performance and lower power features that come with I3C.
Jivaro
Jivaro™ is a netlist reduction platform. It speeds up the simulation time, increases accuracy and also reduces memory footprint.
Variation-Aware Design
Process variability at advanced technology nodes has become the key challenge for IC designers. A new generation of tools are required that provides efficient and...
Layout-Driven 3D Process Simulator
Victory Process is a general purpose 1D, 2D and layout driven 3D process simulator including...
3D Device Simulator
Victory Device enables device technology engineers to simulate the electrical, optical, and thermal behavior...
InVar Reliability Analysis
Silvaco's suite of power integrity software tools, InVar Power, InVar EM/IR and InVar Thermal, provides ....
Parallel SPICE Circuit Simulator
SmartSpice delivers the highest performance and accuracy required to design complex, high-precision analog...
