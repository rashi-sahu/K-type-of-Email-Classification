CUEN Evening Seminar on Tidal Energy in the UK
"Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon: a blueprint for a new kind of energy
infrastructure" by Ton Fijen, Engineering Director, Tidal Lagoon Power
Thursday, 14 May, 4pm | LT1, Dept of Engineering, Trumpington Site
Tidal Lagoon Power is preparing to start construction of the world's first tidal lagoon power plant in Swansea Bay in 2015. The 320MW installed capacity project will establish a blueprint for the rapid roll-out of a fleet of full-scale tidal lagoons that could between them provide 8% of the UK's electricity. With a design life of 120 years, tidal lagoons introduce a new option for affordable renewable energy at a scale not seen before. Predominantly built and funded in the UK, the Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon will kick-start a new UK industry and future export market, present a wide range of opportunities for social and environmental regeneration and position low carbon power generation at the heart of the community. This seminar will examine the plans for the Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon, the technology it will employ, the civil engineering challenges it will navigate, and the new energy market it will open up.
CUEN welcomes Ton Fijen, Engineering Director, Tidal Lagoon Power. Ton Fijen is a well-qualified engineer who has been working in the fields of marine and coastal engineering for more than 30 years. Before joining Tidal Lagoon Power, Ton was based in Stellenbosch, South Africa as a Consulting Engineer and Director of WSP Africa Coastal Engineers. Tidal Lagoon Power is developing a series of UK tidal lagoon power plants. The first of these - the 320MW Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon - is scheduled to enter construction in 2015. Initial plans for a subsequent Cardiff Tidal Lagoon, up to 2,800MW in installed capacity, were first unveiled in March 2015.
Date: Thursday, 14 May 2015, 4pm
Location: LT1, Department of Engineering, Trumpington Site, Cambridge University

CUEN Evening Seminar on "Energy Challenges in the transportation in the UK"
Joint seminar talks by: Dr John Lanham, Associate Dean for Partnerships, FET, UWE Bloodhound@University and Michael Wheeldon, Head of Mechanical, CU Eco Racing
Friday, 8 May, 5pm | LT2, Dept of Engineering, Trumpington Site
Speakers:
Dr John Lanham "BloodhoundSSC - Making it go, keeping it safe and making it stop - some energetic perspectives on designing a 1,000 mph car"
Michael Wheeldon
"The role of solar power in the future transportation in the UK"
After studying Electrical & Electronic Engineering at University College Swansea in the early 1980's, John moved to Coventry to work for GEC in the telecommunications industry. From Coventry he then moved to Manchester and worked at a Teaching Company Associate on a collaborative project between Salford University and International Computers Limited after which he stayed with ICL in Manchester.
He moved to a Lecturing role at Bristol Polytechnic in the department of Engineering.
Alongside his teaching work he embarked on a PhD and worked with a number of local and regional companies on further knowledge exchange and partnership projects. As Bristol Polytechnic transitioned to the University of the West of England in 1992 John's role likewise changed and adapted. In 2003 he was appointed as Head of Department for Design and Engineering, heading a team of
~ 40 academics, a role he continued in through to 2010 when he was appointed to a faculty based role as Associate Dean for International and External Partnerships in the Faculty of Environment and Technology at UWE. In this role John has led FET's expansion in international work and now overseas six major transnational education collaborations and FET's 400+ international students who are studying on the Frenchay campus.
A key activity for John at present is the BloodhoundSSC project of which UWE is a founder sponsor. The aim of the BloodhoundSSC project, led by Richard Noble, is to raise the engagement of youngsters with STEM subjects - STEM - Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics, through the grand challenge of designing, building and running a car to raise the land speed record to 1,000 MPH. Bloodhound aims to share information from the project in new and novel ways and so inspire the next generation of UK engineers - John is leading and coordinating the HE engagement activities for the BloodhoundSSC project. In this role he has worked with the Bloodhound team developing an on-line repository
"K-Box" for university staff and students to access design information, test data and ultimately run data for use in lectures, workshops, projects and case-studies.
Michael's role at CUER involves coordinating the transformation of an aerodynamic shell provided by the aero team into a fully designed solar powered racer, taking it all the way from sketches on pieces of paper, to 3D CAD models to a physical part in the workshop ready to be bolted on to the car. He gets to look at the biggest projects, like the chassis design all the way down to making sure that CUER has enough nuts and bolts to build the suspension! He loves this role because it allows him to take on some project management/leadership responsibilities while still getting his hands dirty with some design, analysis and manufacturing. As the CUER Head of Mechanical, Michael will give a thorough overview of the role of solar power in the transportation in the UK
Date: Friday, 8 May 2015, 5pm

"International Legal Constraints on Energy Transitions"
CUEN Evening Seminar by Professor Jorge E. Vinuales, Harold Samuel Professor of Law and Environmental Policy, Law Faculty, University of Cambridge.
Thursday, 22 January 2015, 6pm | Room B3, Criminology Department, Sidgwick Site, Cambridge
"Energy transition policies are likely to fundamentally redesign the energy matrix on which large portions of the economy are currently based. International law, particularly trade and investment law, were historically developed to place constraints on major regulatory changes in order to ensure a certain degree of liberalisation. This talk will explore the legal space left by international law for the introduction of energy transition policies as well as the strategies to minimise potential frictions."
Please refer to the poster for more information. Followed by the drinks and the networking session. All welcome.

"Sino-Russian Gas and Oil Cooperation: The Reality and Its Impacts towards Regional and Global Trading"
CUEN Evening Seminar by Professor K-W Paik, Associate Fellow of the Energy, Environment, Resource Department at Chatham House and Senior Research Fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.
Tuesday, 2 December 2014, 5pm | Room B3, Criminology Department, Sidgwick Site, Cambridge
On May 21, 2014, the long waited Sino-Russian gas deal was signed, and the 38 bcm/y gas supply from east Siberia to northern China for 30 years (US$ 400 bn worth) was the biggest energy deal ever. In 2013, China had signed two major crude supply deals with Russia, with US$ 355 bn worth. If Altai gas deal with 30 bcm/y volume is added in the coming 12 month, the combined figure of Sino-Russian oil and gas deal will reach US$ 1 trillion. The importance of Sino-Russian gas deal lies in a fact that it will set the benchmark price for northern China's Bohai Bay gas market and will deliver a huge pressure to LNG developers targeting the Chinese LNG market. The US and EU sanctions against Russia with regard to the Ukraine crisis had consolidated Sino-Russian energy relations and consequently China became the biggest beneficiary. Russia is being demonised by its annexation of Crimea Peninsula, but Russia's large scale gas supply to China will help reducing the excessive Asian LNG premium and consequently the expansion of gas use in China. If China's heavy dependence on coal can be changed by the rapid expansion of gas use in China, let's say, China's coal dependence in China's energy mix can be reduced well below 50% by 2030, that will be the biggest contribution to take care of global climate change initiative. Prof. K-W Paik is a top authority on Sino-Russian oil and gas cooperation, and his talk will address the implications of the deal comprehensively.
Please refer to the poster for more information. Followed by the drinks and the networking session. All welcome.
