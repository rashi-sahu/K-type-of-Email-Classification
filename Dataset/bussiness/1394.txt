Dear Job Doctor,I am a qualified ACCA for 17 yrs and have been working for an accountancy firm for over 10 years in a tax role. I would like to change job to broaden my experience. I am thinking of moving to industry. Would it be difficult for me to move after all these years or is it better to stick with public practice?Thanks

Dear Job Doctor,I previously posted on your forum about 2 years ago. At the time I was not yet ACA qualified and stuck in the assurance division. Fast forward to now, I am now ACA qualified and have moved into the corporate finance (valuations) team at a big 4. I undertook the CFA level 1 exam last year but unfortunately did not pass. I am currently considering my future career paths. What options are available?I have looked at moving into the M&A sector but the hours appear long despite the lure of high payI have also considered pursuing an equity analyst role with a view to becoming a funds manager a fair way down the trackTraditionally where would a big 4 valuations person go? Would it be an easier transition to move into M&A or down the funds path?Thanks,Ben

Gaining experience after graduation
Anonymous wrote:Dear Job Doctor,I am a business studies student at the university of kent. Currently I am on a gap year from uni and about to undertake some unpaid work experience with a small accountancy firm. I wanted some advice about what exams I should take after I graduate to became an accountant, what would be the best route for me?Adam Wheeler, a Consultant from WH Marks Sattin replied:Depending which route you want to take, there are a couple of options open to you.First of all there is the ACA (ICAEW or ICAS accredited) qualification. This is by far and way the most prestigious accounting and general business qualification available in the UK.
Then there is the ACCA route which is another accounting qualification available to study for. You can study this anywhere in the world and although the ACA is seen as superior in the UK, other countries recognise the ACCA as well.
Or if you are looking to specialise in tax, the ATT and CTA route is the way forward for you. These qualifications are tax specific and should be sought after if tax is the career you are looking for.If you would like some additional information or a chat, please do not hesitate to contact Adam Wheeler on 0207 321 5000

How can I get support to study for CFA?
Anonymous wrote:"Hi,I am on the verge of finishing my CIMA exams with only my case study remaining. I am keen to study CFA after finishing my CIMA studies. However, I have had two years of experience within retail. I am intending to gain another years of experience to sign off my experince but then shortly change industry. Is it still possible for me to be able to transfer industries inorder to be given study support for CFA? Would it be more appropriate to attain an accountancy position within an investment bank/fund investment company and then transfer internally? What could my difference in career path look like in 3 years time if I was to remain as an accountant as oppossed to pursuing with CFA? Do you think adding CFA to my existing CIMA qualification could enhance my future career? "Elan Diamond a Manager from WH Marks Sattin replied: "You are unlikely to receive study support for CFA unless your role is directly relevent to it. If you move as a "newly qualified CIMA", you might be able to negotiate it as part of your package (again, if relevent to your role). The career path you follow depends extensively on the experience that you have gained -
As you can probably appreciate there are a number of specific questions that can only be answered when I have a better understanding of your background etc. I am happy to be specific and discuss this in more detail if appropriate
- please give me a call on 0207 321 5000All the bestWH Marks Sattin"

How do I make myself appealing for Investment Banking roles?
Dear Job Doctor,I am a newly qualified CA and CTA frmo a Big4 firm. I have been based in a tax function for a little under 4yrs but am now looking to move into an IB. The roles I have been shown so far are predominantly PC and BA roles. My question is this: is it possible for someone with my qualifications and experience to get into trading/sales within an IB? If not, how would I go about making myself more appealing for such roles? Many thanks.Elan Diamond, a Manager from WH Marks Sattin replied:Is it possible? Yes.
However, you may find it a considerably harder to secure a position as this is incredibly popular and competitive area to get into. You will find that the main concern of many employers'
is your commitment to this field. They will see that you have spent 3 years obtaining an accounting qualification , and question why you didn't join a
training scheme with a bank within sales and trading
when you first graduated. You will also need to think about your current salary expectations, as you will probably need to take a cut in salary to compete with the graduates all vying for similar sales and trading roles.If you do have any additional questions,or would just like an informal chat please give me a call on 020 7321 5000
