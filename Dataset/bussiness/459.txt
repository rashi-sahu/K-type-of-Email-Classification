üìπThree Councils discuss the financial costs and benefitsit's not JUST about REPLACING ONE SET OF BENEFITS FOR ANOTHER..
üó™What our customers are saying...
Buckinghamshire County Council
‚ÄúThe system provides a single council-wide repository for all of our contracts. It‚Äôs not all about storage, but how the contracts are managed, especially in terms of checking that contractors are performing to the right standards, are financially stable and have quality processes in place for issues such as safeguarding and business continuity.‚Äù
Mid- Sussex District Council
"As a council we understand how investment in the right technology can enable us to transform - improving the services we provide whilst increasing efficiency across the organisation.‚Äù¬†Mid Sussex District Council ‚ÄúArcus were the obvious partner given their vast knowledge and experience of Local Government, and how to apply the Salesforce ecosystem to our business needs. What impressed us, was their understanding of our ‚Äòend to end‚Äô business processes and their appreciation of the complexity and importance of our services".
Aylesbury Vale District Council
‚ÄúAVDC have hardly had a minute to take breath since going live and I am sure there has been a similar buzz at Arcus. I did want to pause, however, and say thank you to the Arcus team for really putting in the time and effort especially over the last couple of weeks and before! We definitely have an excellent basis for developing the Aylesbury Vale My Account and to support a far reaching digital transformation of Customer experience.‚Äù
Digital Peterborough
‚ÄúI would not hesitate to recommend Arcus for a technology implementation of any complexity. They have an excellent attitude and enthusiasm for their work teamed with a fantastic pool of resources, they are highly skilled, with a flexible and accommodating approach.‚Äù
Tandridge District Council
‚ÄúArcus Building Control allows our officers to be truly mobile. We now see how work that used to be restricted to the office can move to a quick and easy mobile solution. Not only does this save us time and money, but vastly improves our service.‚Äù
Chelmsford City Council
‚ÄúI am pleased to be working closely with Arcus Global to build a Waste Management Software System which will reflect the needs of our service provision and assist us to provide our residents with enhanced services.‚Äù
Mid-Sussex District Council
"The first phase involved understanding the technology landscape across the council and defining a roadmap with Arcus. Arcus has made a real effort to begin rapid deployment of Salesforce Service Cloud as our new CRM and the Arcus Waste Management solution to replace our ageing application. We are excited to be working closely with Arcus on this important programme of work and see this as the start of a long term relationship".
Andrew Grant, Chief Executive Officer, Aylesbury Vale District Council
‚ÄúArcus was a real partner to Aylesbury Vale District Council during the project. Despite delays caused by other suppliers, they have stepped up and shown commitment and flexibility, maintaining the partnering approach‚Äù
Stuart Mitchenall, Tandridge district council
‚ÄúThe Arcus solution allows our officers to be truly mobile. We now see how work that used to be restricted to the office can move to a quick and easy mobile solution. Not only does this save us time and money, but vastly improves our service.‚Äù
