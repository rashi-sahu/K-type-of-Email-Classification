Welcome
Established since 1971, we have been making designer and bespoke jewellery in silver, 9ct, 18ct and Rhiannon Welsh Gold for over 40 years. All of our work is either entirely handmade or hand finished, all of our designs are uniquely our own.
We have always emphasized the importance of quality over quantity, we insist on the best chains and other fittings and our pieces invariably have a more substantial weight and feel relative to most volume jewellery. We also insist on using top quality diamonds and gemstones chosen by our own specialist.
Whether you’re looking for a silver pendant or a specially designed bespoke diamond necklet, Rhiannon should be your first point of call. Please browse the website or contact us to discuss your requirements.
