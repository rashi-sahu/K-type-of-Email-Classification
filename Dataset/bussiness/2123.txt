'Employment Relations Matters'
Industrial Relations Research Unit
A leading European centre for research and analysis on the employment relationship
Our work combines long-term fundamental research and short-term commissioned projects. In both we maintain the independence and integrity of approach which have been the hallmark of IRRU since its establishment in 1970. The Director of IRRU is Professor Guglielmo Meardi.
We aim to advance understanding of the rapidly changing world of employment through in-depth, critical and theoretically-informed empirical research. In so doing, we also seek to improve the quality of data and analysis available for policy-making by government, employers and trade unions.
OVERVIEW
The three main themes of IRRU’s research has been reframed as three streams, to bring them more in line with the teaching and research activity of the Organisation and Human Resource Management (OHRM) teaching group, whose composition largely overlaps with that of IRRU.
Employment relations strategy: this stream focuses on the implications of managerial and employee representatives’ strategies for organisational performance and equality, and on how environmental, institutional and governance factors shape organisations’ employment relations. This includes, through the insights of pluralist and critical industrial relations perspectives, HRM strategy, mechanisms of employee voice, union (and other stakeholder) strategies, and systems of collective bargaining.
Social responsibility, equality and diversity: this stream focuses on issues concerning equality, diversity, careers and work-life balance, exploring: how organisations manage workforce career aspirations and work-family conflict; how typically-disadvantaged groups (such as women, ethnic minorities, disabled people and older workers) are affected by different organisational approaches to equality, and react to them; and the link between employment relations and inequality.
Multi-level governance in a global context: This stream focuses on both employment relations in the EU and also the multi-level governance of employment in a global context, including international soft law, international and regional organisations, national regulations and sub-national systems. It combines the study of public and private actors, and focuses in particular on: the dissemination of HRM practices in multinational companies; the setting of global labour standards; international co-ordination of collective bargaining and employment policies; and cross-country phenomena such as migration and international restructuring.
