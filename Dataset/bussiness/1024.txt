JOHN COOPER WORKS
INSPIRED BY A LEGEND
The association with racing legend John Cooper began over 50 years ago, when this performance pioneer developed the original Mini into the track-ready Mini Cooper. With a powerful new engine and uprated brakes, a speed demon was born: one that could be enjoyed by the public and rally drivers alike.
