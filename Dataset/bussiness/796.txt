With a passion for art and all things magical as a little girl, Leeca began to draw, and It soon became clear to her parents and mentors that there was something brewing. As Leeca grew, so did her faeries, who have now blossomed to be beautiful depictions of a woman's love, lust, preservation and power.
All original and hand drawn, Leeca's work now shows in galleries all over the world.
Each Faerie can be purchased as a greetings card or print, and you may even be able to get your hands on an original design.
All enquiries welcome, as well as commissions.
