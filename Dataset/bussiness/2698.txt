Josef Frank: Dreaming in Textiles at the Fashion and Textile Museum
The Fashion and Textile Museum brings us yet another brilliant exhibition in their modest but incredibly well curated space on Bermondsey Street. On till the 7th May 2017, the Fashion and Textile Museum is celebrating the work of Austrian architect and designer Josef Frank (1885 – 1967), whose textile designs continue to inspire with their ‘unabashed colour and optimism’.
Frank is best known for his amazingly bright, bold fabric and wallpapers and his distinctive furniture designs for Svenskt Tenn.

Breathless: The Essence of Glass
December 21, 2016·0 comments
Breathless was an interactive exhibition organised by Czech Centre London based on the award-winning Dechem Studio’s passion for glassmaking, in partnership with OKOLO. Exhibiting for London Design Festival 2016, in the Brompton Design District, Breathless brought together the history of glass making with a live glass blowing exhibit in the beautiful space of the Garage at 1 North Terrace.
