Welcome
Digital Locksmiths' principle role is to provide consultancy, technical support and development services for security and smartcard related projects. To meet these aims, the Digital Locksmiths draw on over 40 years of smartcard experience of the founders. The Digital Locksmiths can also access a wide variety of specialist help from a pool of associates and former colleagues, built up over years of active participation in the digital security industry. The combination of in-house talent and extensive external connections means no project is either too big or too small for the Digital Locksmiths.
We have expertise covering the full spectrum of smartcard initiatives, with particular emphasis on the following:
Finance - EMV, ePurse
Government - ICAO, identity and citizen's cards
Transport - ITSO consultancy and product development
