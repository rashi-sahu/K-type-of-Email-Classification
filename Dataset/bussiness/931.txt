Audio Watermarking SDKs for iOS, Android & Web Browsers. Find Out More
Audience Research
Many radio stations all over the world are continuously encoded with Intrasonics audio watermarks. Depending on where you are, perhaps when you listen to your favourite radio station, it’s carrying our watermarks (not that you could hear them).
FIND OUT MORE
Advertising Reach
By inserting audio watermarks into broadcast ads, advertisers can track real exposure via Intrasonics-enabled apps on viewers’ phones and tablets. This makes possible a whole new paradigm in measurement and mobile ad targeting.
WATCH OUR VIDEO
Synchronised Apps
We provide our audio watermarking SDKs to agencies, app developers, production houses and broadcasters. We’ve seen them create some award-winning second screen apps that synchronise perfectly with content on TV, radio and in cinema.
SEE SOME EXAMPLES
Interactive Toys
Using our compact and low cost decoder modules, we can help manufacturers produce physical devices such as toys and mascots that can detect audio watermark triggers in broadcast TV shows or in movies and respond in all kinds of ways.
