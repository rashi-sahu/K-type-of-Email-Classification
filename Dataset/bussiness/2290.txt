Compared with
fossil fuels and nuclear power, renewable energy
that harnesses the sun, the wind and other
natural energy flows is relatively
benign. In particular, very few pollutants
are emitted per unit of energy
generated. Moreover, renewables provide a
diverse, secure and inexhaustible source of
energy. Coupled with a programme of improved
energy efficiency, renewable energy displaces
finite or less benign energy sources in response
to peak oil and climate change.
All
energy systems have an impact on the natural
environment. It is inevitable, therefore, that
conflicts of interest will arise between
providing energy services and ensuring that
people, wildlife and open spaces are adequately
protected. The environmental impacts of most
renewable energy technologies are considerably
less than those of the current energy systems
they displace. Visual intrusion is sensed only
by humans, but nevertheless is extremely
important. If there is an understanding of
the benefits of a particular installation, then
the physiological and aesthetic impact is likely
to be favourable.
The Pro
Wind Alliance (ProWA) is an association of local
individuals and groups who are convinced that
renewables are vital for the future and who are
therefore in favour
of developing properly designed local
renewable generating capability. ProWA aims to provide
objective information, backed by sound research
and references. In particular,
ProWA supported the planning applications for
the projects listed
below and supports the projects listed under
Current Wind Power Proposals. An overview table
with details of all the projects ProWA has
supported or is currently supporting can be
found here.
ProWA
strongly supports the principle of windfarm
operators funding Community Funds. For instance,
the operator makes annual payments over the full
life of the windfarm to the local Council, which
oversees the distribution to local schools,youth
organisations, environmental groups, village
halls, sports clubs etc. Such funds can amount
to many thousands of pounds each year, depending
on the size of the windfarm. This is not
bribery, but common sense.
