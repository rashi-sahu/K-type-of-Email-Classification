Investigating
UK Universities through Freedom of Information
Reports
Workplace
Bullying & Harassment
We
examined the numbers of bullying complaints at all universities
and uncovered a huge disparity in the proportion of upheld
complaints between Russell Group and Million + universities.
Employment Tribunal Claims
& Gagging Clauses
We
asked universities to tell us how many staff had made employment
tribunal claims, what the outcomes were, whether gagging
agreements were signed and how much was spent on legal fees.
TV
Interview Permission Requirements
We
researched the requirements for university staff to gain
permission before they give television interviews about their
work. The report includes the precise wording used by many of
the institutions.
