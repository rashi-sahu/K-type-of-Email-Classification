FACTORY VISIT NO. 10 : ALEX BEGG / BEGG & CO., AYR, SCOTLAND
Last week, I had one of the best days of my working life to date. It’s been 7 years since I started visiting factories around the UK but until now I’ve not had the chance to incorporate it into my day job too much.
At Winkreative, we’ve been lucky enough to work with the wonderful team at Begg & Co., a cashmere scarf and throw maker of the highest quality, over the last few years — taking the brand from idea to firmly established in a relatively short amount of time. This has only been possible through the team’s expertise which comes from Alex Begg, a company with over 150 years of experience in producing the finest scarves for some well-known luxury fashion brands.
Given I was there for the day with work, I sadly didn’t have the chance to interview the workers themselves, but we were shown around by David Woodhouse, the technical director of Alex Begg. To spend a couple of hours with David is a real thrill for anyone with an interest in textile manufacturing — he has decades of experience and many a great anecdote.
The Alex Begg factory is in Ayr, an hour or so drive from Glasgow airport. It’s an unassuming set-up from the outside, sat opposite a grey block of flats on a side road in the town. Once inside it’s a treat. Machines old and state-of-the-art sit side-by-side, workers of all ages go about their incredibly intricate and painstaking work with quiet efficiency.
A few highlights from our two hour tour with David below:
The yarn store: where order reins supreme.
An incredible weaving machine, where the master weavers thread all the yarn through to begin making fabric.
Into the next room where we were shown these stunning machines that can weave like the clappers.
Before the scarves leave the factory for retailers, they go through a rigorous washing and, well, beating process. This machine was pummelling away. It's part of the reason why Alex Begg cashmere can be so soft.
For its scarves, Begg & Co. uses teasels, which have largely been pushed out of favour by metal ones over the last century. In the first photo, David is showing us how they can be packed into the frames. The frames are then placed on to a machine (second photo) with a rotating hub that the material is wrapped around. The momentum 'raises the nap'.
Brilliantly, David tracked down a teasel grower in Italy in order to ensure the best quality and size crop for Begg to use. The farmer has two fields just for Begg.
We also learnt about the origin of 'on tenterhooks'.... It turns out that it's related to the drying of fabric and ensuring it doesn't lose its shape. David recommended a book that covers textile terms — I need to ask him to remind me of its title.
This final image is of the press that all products go through before leaving the factory. The stacks of paper were sourced by David and are uniquely coated for the task. However, the production of them has ceased — so once it's gone, it's gone. Any producers of such items, do get in touch!
For more images of the visit, please head over to the M&I Facebook page.

DIGEST: MADE IN BRITAIN SPECIAL, LONDON DESIGN FESTIVAL, MIDDLEPORT POTTERY, HIUT DENIM
The FT had a Made in Britain special recently:
Made in Britain, part one: lighting
Building on the country’s strong heritage in industrial engineering, designers are experimenting with new materials and modern techniques. In addition, higher costs and demand for locally sourced products has increasingly seen the production process shift back to the UK from Asia.
-
Made in Britain, part two: furniture design
British designers are in demand throughout the world for their skills and high quality craftsmanship. Events such as the London Design Festival and Clerkenwell Design Week attract increasingly large international audiences keen to see, and crucially, buy what UK furniture makers are producing.
This video that features furniture designer Sebastian Cox discussing the closure of furniture courses and Zeev Aram on the absurdity of exporting UK trained talent only to import their designs is also worth a watch.
-
Middleport Pottery and its workers
Some may wonder why saving Middleport is so important, given that it is merely one of many factories in the area. The fact is, though, that Middleport is special. It is the only factory left that still uses the finest method (apart from hand-painting) of applying decoration – the 19th-century underglaze transfer printing method, which depends upon hand-engraving the patterns on to rollers.

Tautz collections.Eight videos of the Makers of E Tautz -For thirty years Gladys Jones and Sir Adrian Cadbury worked at the same factory in Bournville in Birmingham, but never met. They now come together to reflect on their lives then and now, and the love of chocolate and sport that unites them.A great programme on Bournville's chocolate factory workers-It was my privilege to work with Butler & Tanner, one of the greats of the golden age of British printing, which sadly went into administration yesterday with the loss of one hundred jobs. Thus a company that started in 1845 is no more and its history ends here.So long, Butler & Tanner (Spitalfields Life)-Having worked with Olivetti, Alessi, Cappellini, Flos, Muji and SCP amongst others, designer Jasper Morrison is a powerhouse of British design, with recent commissions including furniture for the Tate Modern, the ATM desk for Vitra and a range of pots&pans for Alessi.

FACTORY VISIT NO.9 : PERSAUD'S BAGS / J&A DESIGNS, HOMERTON
“You missed me,” wrote Junior Persaud in his first email . It came with a link to a story on Spitalfields Life. This was in October last year. A few weeks later, on a damp winter’s evening I was stood in his Homerton factory along with my friend Julian, the photographer for this visit.
“You’ve missed quite a few guys. In Somerset, Clarks village, there were lots of factories nearby. The satchel company, not Cambridge Satchel: the Satchel Company. All of these guys used to work for Clarks. Then they moved it all to China, the whole industry was left, the whole village. Can you imagine what that did to them?”
For Persaud, the business of making bags seems to be as much, if not more, about the people and their stories as it is about the product and profit. An hour spent with Junior is a fascinating one. Within moments of us arriving he’s telling us about his newborn boy (who arrived just days earlier), showing us around the cluttered space, explaining the company’s history and plucking metal frames from hooks hanging above to explain different jobs undertaken over the years. Despite the sheer amount of work and tools that surround us, Persaud knows exactly where everything is.
Demand is high for J&A’s creations, when we leave, two machinists are still working away while chatting to friends and family on their phones (in-ear headphones required, to allow for hands-free talk), according to Persaud, late nights are common at present.
J&A has produced bags for the likes of Paul Smith, Lulu Guinness, Christopher Raeburn and Ally Cappellino over the years. Needless to say, the quality is of a premium. “We use point eight gauge steel here, whereas the Chinese bag makers will use point five, point six. Ours is a tenth of the thickness of a Lancia. They’re not the toughest cars but for a handbag that’s pretty good. We hand braise everything. Everything is double welded so we can give our fittings a life range of eight years. Ally (Cappellino) wants her bags to last so we’ve toughened up our frames as much as we can. They’ve got a good shelf life.” On this particular evening, some sturdy looking numbers are being made for product designer Tom Dixon. Persaud’s address book, a who’s who of British design over the years, would be the envy of many.
As we shuffle about this vast old warehouse, Persaud’s story hurtles back-and-forth, with tales of brothers who traded exotic animal skins decades ago to the coming of the “hop, skip and jump” Olympic Park, situated a javelin throw away from the premises we’re stood in.
“I lost a lot of suppliers. I struggled. I had to go out of London. We had all our workforce round here. Dad (pictured above, in photo frame, on scooter) had this building and the workers would all live in the flats opposite; they’d roll out of bed and straight into here.”
The construction of the Olympic Park saw Persaud (and East London) lose a whole cluster of manufacturing businesses that are unlikely to return. He reels off a list of companies and characters that were lost: the mattress maker, Mr. Ettinger (“The council started to strip the machines down to move them and they just fell apart. You can’t move a machine that’s been sat there for 50 years.”), the board cutters (“Their machine was sat there for donkey’s years, they started to strip down the machines, the machines couldn’t take it. Neither could the guy who was running it.”) and the guy who rewound the motors (“The motors
- they’re quite huge and the winding machines were massive and quite complex, built into the building. And the same happened: these guys came along and took apart the machine. Those machines can’t be recalibrated again.”)
“They wiped the whole lot with one hit. That left a lot of these guys in problems and a lot of it went over to China. But now it’s coming back. What I need to do is build that ecosystem back up,” Persaud says, optimistically.
The ecosystem he talks of encompasses a wide array of makers, “Quality Castings, Premier Plating. These guys are a lot older than us and they don’t advertise, not much of a website. Nothing. The more chance we have of them sticking around, the better. We’ll regret it if they go.”
Alongside sourcing suppliers, he’s doing his best to encourage new blood into the industry, “We have to show the guys that this is not a woman’s trade. It’s a serious job, there’s a lot of engineering goes into a bag, the amount of companies we have to go and see to see each individual finish. We take on people all the time. I try start them off young, 18 -23. But we take people on to their mid-thirties. London College of Fashion help me out a lot with pattern makers.”
As well as his desire to keep business buoyant, Persaud also has a very keen interest in the heritage and history of British bag making. Earlier, he tells us of a visit with his dad to a Birmingham factory that was winding up production, “They had a ‘Hall of Frame’! It featured everything from 1800 to 1998 or whenever it was. We didn’t have any money but we’d always find a way of buying the tooling. A lot of them owned the copyrights to different frames – the English Inverted, the Queen mum has her bags made with that frame.” He tells us that many of their clearance purchases are still in storage, “at my mum’s place, we have a garage absolutely stacked full. It’s the fear of something important getting lost,” he confesses, “That’s why we’re holding on to the frames and fittings, we want to get them back up and running, because a lot of the stuff that’s made in China is based on old British manufacturing companies from back down the line.”
“It’s not about the money for me. Otherwise, why would I do it? These guys will pick up companies, strip them to their bones, relocate parts of it and try to make money out of it. The guys who are left are without a job and there’s no one to pass the skills on to. There’s a lot of guys who you’re going to miss out on.”

DIGEST: LONDON CRAFTSPEOPLE, CERAMICS IN STOKE, FASHION AND ORIGIN, A NEW IDENTITY FOR MADE IN UK
"In 2007, I started a photographic project about people who run such
businesses. It was to be an addition to my portfolio, an excursion into
portraiture that I had planned to complete in a few months. Instead, I
continued to photograph shops and workshops, shopkeepers, and craftsmen
and -women for the following six years.
I was curious about people, who, despite unglamorous routines, take
pride in their work and have a sense of themselves closely linked to
their occupation."

"Made in Britain was launched by Liverpool cooker manufacturer Stoves.
The company ran a competition inviting students to design a marque that
could be applied to its products to show they were made in the UK and
later invited other companies to use the symbol.
The campaign has since re-launched as an independent organisation and
the original logo – a red, white and blue ribbon/check mark by
Nottingham student Cynthia Lee, above - has been replaced with a flexible and versatile design from The Partners." (Creative Review)

DIGEST: HOPS, VISIBLE MENDING, SILK WEAVING IN MACCLESFIELD, HORN BUTTONS, THE NEW INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION
"Present at each stage of production are the standards and inimitable
know-how accumulated over the last 150 years. Over that time, a few
things have changed — some faster than others — but it’s still the
precise same product off the line, same portraits of the founders in the
entrance-way, and the same name above the door."
A characteristically well put together piece on the last horn button factory in the UK,
in the West Midlands, from S.E.H Kelly. I sometimes struggle to keep up
with their output, so I suggest you peruse their site's 'Makers' section in its entirety.
