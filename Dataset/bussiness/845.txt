"I was fortunate to spend 2 hours with Jane refining my pitch for WA IOTY. While extremely knowledgeable, experienced and professional, Jane is also down to earth, personable and generous with her time. I found her feedback on my presentation very helpful and would happily recommend her to anyone needing help with an investor pitch."

"As a mentor, Jane has given me great confidence, not only in my own leadership skills, but also as a businesswoman. She has encouraged me to network better, stand tall and be proud of my achievements, and has facilitated some important connections. Jane's genuine, honest and when necessary, direct style assisted me in taking Kanopy to the next level...and beyond!"
