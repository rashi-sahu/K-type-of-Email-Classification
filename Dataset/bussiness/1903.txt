Startup Loan
Raising the funds to kick-start a business can often be a barrier to developing good ideas. Antur Teifi’s team can help  you identify ways of accessing finance.
Antur Teifi is the official delivery partner for Start Up Loans across Powys, Ceredigion, Carmarthenshire, Pembrokeshire and North Wales.  This means that individuals wanting to start up a business can access borrowing, in the first 2 years of trading, at 6.19% APR. Loans can be between £1,000 and £25,000 with a repayment term of one to five years. Dedicated Business Advisers will support the client through the application process.
Start Up Loans are available to businesses yet to launch or those that have been trading for up to 2 years.
Once an individual receives their repayable loan they will also be given access to an expert mentor and business offers.
Our work in the Teifi Valley
We continue to invest in order for individuals and businesses in the Teifi Valley to thrive and grow.
