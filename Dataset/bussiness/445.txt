Amantys Power Electronics is combining the world of power electronics with advanced digital and software technology to improve the availability, cost and efficiency of high power systems.
Isolated DC-DC Converter
Amantys introduces a new Isolated DC-DC Converter for traction applications. Featuring high isolation (12kV peak), output short-circuit protection and output overload protection, it can survive common faults and mishandling within a traction converter. In addition, the Isolated DC-DC converter offers high efficiency power conversion (up to 90%) to minimise losses. Designed to comply with EN50155 for railway applications the Isolated DC-DC Converter is a robust, efficient, high power solution for powering gate drives and other railway applications.

Traction Retrofit
At Innotrans 2016 Amantys Power Electronics demonstrated Intelligent Gate Drives for traction applications, featuring remote configuration and downloadable fault counters. Amantys has already shown how intelligent gate drives can benefit the traction converter manufacturer, and the operating and maintenance company.
For more information read our white paper on Power Converter Retrofit Solutions to see how intelligent gate drives can benefit existing power converters.
White Paper
Amantys has also demonstrated IGBT Junction Temperature Estimation, the next major technology development in Intelligent Gate Drives. Junction temperature estimation will enable over temperature and degradation detection in the power converter stack as well as enhanced power rating control.
