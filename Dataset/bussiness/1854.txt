Views on UKSIF
“Last year’s Ownership Day was the first event of its kind and I am delighted, in my capacity as Vice-Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Responsible Investment, to be able to lend my support to the campaign again this year.  If we are to successfully mitigate the effects of mega-trends such as climate change and resource depletion on people’s savings and pensions then it is important that we encourage those investors to talk to the companies they invest in about their environmental, social and governance concerns.”
Martin Horwood MP
Vice-Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Responsible Investment
