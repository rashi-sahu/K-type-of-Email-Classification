Words from the Chairman
Welcome to an exciting new chapter in the history of the National Honey Show. We have a splendid new venue at Sandown Park Racecourse in Esher, Surrey. All our many activities will now be under one roof and we will have much more space for the honey show and for our traders. We will even have our own food court. There is ample car parking and a local railway station. Access from the M25 is easy. Just leave the M25 at junction 10 and follow the big brown Sandown Park signs.
John Chapple completed his term as President at the 2015 show. John has contributed an enormous amount to the 'National' and we are delighted that he remains part of the team. In his place we welcome our new President The Rev Francis Capener, also a stalwart supporter and patron of the show.
Our new hosts at Sandown Park have made us feel very welcome and we are, as ever, grateful to our sponsor The Worshipful Company of Wax Chandlers. This year, we have sponsorship for the filming of the lectures, generously donated by the C. B. Dennis British Beekeepers' Research Trust.
It is inevitable that we will not get everything right first time in our new venue. Please bear with us. Remember, the show is run entirely by volunteers who generously give their time and expertise. The core team grows to around 100 people at show time. A huge thank you to all the show team. Come and see the new look show. Get those entries in, book some workshops and start writing that shopping list for our expanded trade hall. See you there!
