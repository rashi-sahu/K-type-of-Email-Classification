What The Party Leaders Say
The Rt Hon Theresa May MP, First Lord of the Treasury , Minister for the Civil Service and Prime Minister
"Since it was founded in 1977, the IPT has dedicated itself to bridging the gap between legislators and the business community. All parliamentarians should have a good understanding of business, and it is vital Parliament understands the pressures businesses face as they look to expand and provide the jobs and prosperity we need. The IPT’s unique Fellowship programme is an opportunity to acquire a greater understanding of industry through direct experience spent with organisations, whether FTSE100 multinationals or SMEs, across the UK. It helps immensely in developing a two-way dialogue that can only benefit us all."
