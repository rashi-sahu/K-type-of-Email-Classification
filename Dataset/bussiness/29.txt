GM Freeze is calling for a Freeze on:
Growing genetically modified plants and the production (for any purpose) of genetically modified farm animals.
Importing genetically modified foods, plants, farm crops and farm animals and foods/feeds from genetically modified plants and animals.
Patenting genetic resources for food and farm crops.
The GM Freeze campaign is supported by a wide alliance of organisations sharing the public's deep concern about the speed at which genetic modification is being introduced into food and farming. We are united by a belief that we must stop and think about the huge implications of this new technology and the questions that remain to be answered about its safety and impact.
