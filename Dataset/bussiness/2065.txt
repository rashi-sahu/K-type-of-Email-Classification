Page Content NavWelcome to UKTradeInfo
This web site is managed by HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) Trade Statistics unit, and operates alongside the main HMRC website for the purpose of publishing and hosting UK trade statistics data.
These statistics record the movement - for trade purposes - of goods between the UK and both EU and non-EU countries.
They are collected from the EU-wide Intrastat survey and from Customs import and export entries, both administered by HMRC.
