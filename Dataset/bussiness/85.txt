We believe the most exciting innovations originate from the power of networks – physical, social and commercial: the smart connected world.
Over the past 18 years we have funded and supported more than 90 young companies, led by entrepreneurs who share this vision. Their contributions to the smart connected world range from creating the infrastructure of today’s networks, to building the products and services that leverage and transform those networks into economic success.
We have the imagination to see where new businesses can be created and the technical insight, operational experience and global network to help entrepreneurs make their vision a reality.
