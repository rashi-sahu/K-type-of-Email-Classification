Parents To Be
Our advances in technology can improve IVF success rates and your ability to conceive and accurately screen common chromosome conditions of your baby once you are pregnant.
Preconception & Fertility
We believe in empowering informed choices in families' reproductive futures. That starts with preconception genetic testing and the latest advancements in preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD).
Pregnancy
Our verifi Prenatal Test is raising the standards in noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT). Delivering timely, reliable answers about common chromosome conditions of a developing fetus — via a simple, single blood draw — it minimizes the need for riskier invasive procedures.
Genetic Health
We’re pioneering genetic disease research in rare and undiagnosed diseases and inherited conditions. We also offer IVD carrier screening for cystic fibrosis that provides valuable answers and guidance for the individuals and families affected.
Products & Services
Illumina solutions in next-generation sequencing (NGS) and microarray technologies deliver fast, accurate information that can guide choices and transform lives at multiple touchpoints along the reproductive and genetic health journey.
Learn More
The verifi Prenatal Test was developed by, and its performance characteristics were determined by Verinata Health, Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of Illumina, Inc. The VHI laboratory is CAP-accredited and certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Innovative technologies
At Illumina, our goal is to apply innovative technologies to the analysis of genetic variation and function, making studies possible that were not even imaginable just a few years ago. It is mission critical for us to deliver innovative, flexible, and scalable solutions to meet the needs of our customers. As a global company that places high value on collaborative interactions, rapid delivery of solutions, and providing the highest level of quality, we strive to meet this challenge. Illumina innovative sequencing and array technologies are fueling groundbreaking advancements in life science research, translational and consumer genomics, and molecular diagnostics.
