Project: Cubert
ChallengeCubert uniquely combines the ability to power and charge portable devices with a touch dimmable LED desk light. Our client, Colebrook Bosson Saunders (CBS), approached us to take the original concept from inception into high volume production for the commercial consumer market.The shared goal was to blend CBS’s ergonomic design philosophy with Plextek’s electronics design and manufacturing capability to create a unique product, while satisfying the quality, cost and robustness demands of high volume production and the competitive commercial market.ApproachThe combined team quickly evolved early concepts by defining the priorities and constraints that each party could rapidly identify from the extensive experience in their disciplines. Early functional trial systems were created to gather feedback from usability sessions in order to refine the design. With an understanding of commercial market requirements, Plextek designed the electrical solution to worldwide safety and EMC regulatory standards from the outset, without impacting the product capability or cost. Cubert includes a number of circuit boards, bespoke embedded software and custom components – all designed, created, tested and managed by Plextek. Taking ownership of this whole process unburdens a customer who may not have time, resource or sufficient experience to complete the process effectively or efficiently.The same is also true of two consequent crucial stages in a successful commercial product; regulatory approval and volume manufacture. Plextek liaised directly with test houses on the client’s behalf to define and obtain necessary approvals. Long standing involvement in volume manufacturing means Plextek were able to identify partners around the world specifically suitable for this high quality product. The process included selected on-site audits followed by management of data transfer to create a low risk route to production realisation.OutcomeWorking closely with CBS’s design team, Plextek provided the technical expertise to enhance the CBS award winning mechanical product portfolio with the addition of an intelligent electrical device. Plextek’s electronics, software and manufacturing capabilities enabled CBS to deliver this unique user centric device without compromise in its compact and aesthetic form. It is now an established product in the consumer electronics market.Plextek have decades of experience in creating and delivering exceptional quality electronic solutions, including the consequential expertise in volume manufacturing and obtaining regulatory approvals.Cubert is an award winning smart electronic device which has enabled CBS to expand into new markets, provide existing clients with an exciting new product, and create new customer bases worldwide.
