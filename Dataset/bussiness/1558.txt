Meghann Jones, VP of Public Affairs for Ipsos North America states: “Mondelēz International is the first cocoa company to commit to publish the findings in detail - a huge step for transparency in the industry.

Rap it up! By day, Fernando Junior is a logistics assistant at our #Curitiba Plant in #Brazil. But in his free time, he loves music, so he decided to bring his passion to work: “My idea was to show our commitment to a safety-conscious culture in our plants,” says Fernando. "So, I thought, why not put that to rap!" #GreatPlace2WorkView

Ready, set, go! Our #TeamMDLZ U.S. colleagues joined After-School All-Stars and primary school students for a fun afternoon of career exploration with a “CEO Relay Race.” Kids had the chance to ask employees about their career paths and education, and the team gave some inspiration about future careers (plus some help on their science, technology, engineering and math projects)! #CommunityView

Our #JoyAmbassadors have arrived in #Ghana as part of our skills exchange program! These past few days, they’ve been busy learning from local farmers how cocoa is grown, harvested, fermented and dried to make the chocolate we know and love! “It's amazing all the hard work that goes into cocoa farming, from growing and harvesting the cocoa pods at just the right time, to breaking open each pod and wrapping them up in plantain leaves for fermentation, and finally sun drying the beans while turning them every 15 minutes”, said Joy Ambassador Alice. #CocoaLifeView
