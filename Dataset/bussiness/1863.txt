I'm supporting Corbyn for the same reasons I supported Thatcher
In my nearly forty years I've only really supported, or had any faith in, two British politicians - Jeremy Corbyn, and Margaret Thatcher.
Both times, it was for much the same reason. British politics occasionally seems to slip into a consensus, a status quo bias, that is wrong, and harmful, and needs to be overturned.
Thatcher overturned a political consensus that the mission of the British government was the orderly management of British decline and championed the market capitalism that was needed to make Britain prosperous. Now that market capitalism has deformed into neofeudalism, the political consensus that we need more austerity, fewer public services, lower taxes, no public housing and a collective surrender to the decisions of a handful of corporations needs to be overturned instead.
So I support Jeremy Corbyn for what I consider the obvious reasons.

The man elected eight times who we're supposed to believe is unelectable
Is Jeremy Corbyn electable? Trivially so. His constituents keep electing him. They do so in ever-greater numbers. They've done it eight times. "Unelectable" is not a useful charge to levy against a man who keeps getting elected. As well say that the sea is dry or that fish fly south for the winter.
Ah, but. Islington North is not Britain, the argument goes. Islington North is an unrepresentative bubble of weird, rich, London left-wingers. The country as a whole will never elect a left-wing politician.
Which would be debatable (not true, but at least debatable), if Scotland hadn't just elected 56 of them. Check out the manifesto that a handful of months ago wiped all of the other (indistinguishable, centre-right, neoliberal) parties off the Scottish political map. End austerity and raise taxes. Fund the welfare state and the NHS. Scrap Trident. It's not a strikingly dissimilar policy agenda to this one. The argument that people won't vote for this left-wing lunacy also falls down at the existence proof stage. They just did it. This manifesto just swept an entire country.

Don't bother turning off electronic devices
A couple of weeks ago the New York Times ran a piece pointing out that while plane passengers are asked to turn off their mobile phones during take-off and landing, no-one knows why. The Times speculated that if just 1% of American plane passengers secretly left their devices on, that meant 11 million flights a year somehow managed to stay in the air even though someone had left their phone on.
The 1% number was just a guess, though. So last week I got the guys at my company, Holiday Extras, to run a poll and ask our customers. We run our polls on the "welcome back" email we send to customers, so we know that all of our respondents have just flown back from a holiday.

Stop following me!
Scott Adams wrote recently about the increasingly poor online shopping experience. Every time you buy anything online you need to register, enter discount codes, work out shipping costs, struggle through endless attempts to sell you extra things you don't want...it's no longer possible to meaningfully comparison shop because every online retailer hides the final price in different ways, and it's already easier to just go to a damned shop.
My own frustration shoping online is with ad retargeting.

Ad-lapsing, or TV plus or minus ten minutes
Appointment television ceased to be appointment television when we all got TiVos. We could skip the ads so we skipped the ads. Then we all got Twitter, and appointment television became appointment television again because what's the fun of watching Xfactor or The Apprentice or Dr Who the day after the twitter stream has flown by?
There's a couple of possible solutions to this, but the one that strikes me as most obviously achievable without the invention of any new technology is for us all to agree to a minor conspiracy.

On metaphor and pseudoantineofeudalism
This weekend I saw two things with the same uncompromising message. Charlie Brooker's latest Black Mirror 15 Million Merits, and the Timberlake / Seyfried film In Time.
Both apply the brutally belaboured metaphor of time as money and depict a class of indentured post-industrial serfs slaving away at pointedly mindless tasks for, in Brookerverse, the "merits" (Facebook likes times retweets times pounds) they need to buy everything from toothpaste to ad-skipping, and for the doomed residents of the In Time ghetto literally the minutes and hours they need to keep their hearts beating. Both depict a vast underclass grinding away to support a neofeudal aristocracy (in the one case of bankers, in the other a thinly-disguised Simon Cowell analogue celebrity freak-wrangler). Both offer the same escape routes for their doomed underclass - blind chance, inheritance and gambling.
So far so mind-numbingly obvious. The funny bit is that I paid thirty quid to take my parents to see In Time and we sat through maybe half an hour of ads while watching 15 Million Merits.

Contra Farmville for Dummies
The appearance on Amazon of the book Farmville for Dummies - a self-consciously dummed-down how-to for Zynga's Facebook "game" that is absolutely nothing more than a time-sink without an iota of mental challenge - so depressed Umair Haque today that he declared it the end of culture.
"You know what's really cool about our culture?" he tweeted. "Oh wait. I can't think of anything."
Hyperbole is hyperbole. But since this is a cultural golden age, I do not like to see the odd bump in the road cause one of our greatest minds to write off the whole thing. Contra Farmville for Dummies, therefore, a handful of points in favour of the culture at the start of the second decade of the third millenium.

Gatwick Hilton pages: what I've been working on
For anyone who's curious what I've been up to since I joined Holiday Extras as Editor about four months ago, see left and click on the link for the new Gatwick Hilton pages.
We've been working to roll out new content on the site - first by going out and actually collecting that content, visiting hotels and car parks and photographing and writing up our experiencs. Second by redesigning the pages that content sits on so it's not just easy for the Google robot to read but engaging for real live humans too.
Four months and one page sounds like a pretty slender return on Holiday Extras' investment, but in fact we've got another 20-30 hotels all visited, photographed and written up ready to go live too.
Photographs by me, words by me (edited by my senior copywriter Sarah), page design by Oak and technical implementation mainly by our SEO team. Plenty more to do and we're going to be redesigning the whole thing again almost immediately but just for the moment...that's what I've been up to. Let me know how you'd make it better.

One of the basic tests of whether what you do is good or bad is whether you can imagine, having done it, going home and saying to your parent(s), partner(s), kids or friends "hey guys, guess what I did today?" Or as Louis Brandies most elegantly put it, "sunlight is the best disinfectant". Things are done furtively in the dark that no-one would be willing to own up to in the light of day.
On Friday Laurie Penny kicked off a debate about misogyny online when she pointed out that for airing her opinions she is regularly subject to threats, abuse and all sorts of hate from anonymous - presumably male - commentators. Many other women have since commented that they have been subject to similar abuse. The fact that women say things apparently drives some men into a violent fury, and many websites give them the option of venting that fury through anonymous trolling.

Rogue caption writer at the Globe and Mail
With thanks to @timhardford and @stevesilberman, just recording some of the work of the rogue caption writer at the Globe and Mail for posterity before they notice and take it down.
The full gallery is (was) here, and using a celeb gallery to raise awareness of Occupy Wall Street is funny. Hats off to the guy, who is presumably now looking for a new job.
