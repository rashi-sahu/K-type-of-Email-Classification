Want to
save time and money?
Our operations experts can work with you to find the best solution for your brand. Our latest innovation allows you to only shoot a model once whilst your collection is shot separately on our custom made mannequin. The technology then dresses the model in your clothing as if she was photographed wearing it.
That means, you can:
Significantly reduce your recurring photography costs
Cut your time to market by eliminating the need for reshoots
Improve the consistency of images across your eCommerce landing pages
Gain access to higher profile models as we only need to shoot them once
What are the
Results?
Happy shoppers and happy clients seeing higher dwell times, higher engagement and higher sales.
