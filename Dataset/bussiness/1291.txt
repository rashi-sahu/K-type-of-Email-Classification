We’re proud to be in partnership with Good Energy, a green electricity company that uses the amazing power of British sun, wind and water to replace every bit of electricity you use in your home over the course of a year. They’re developing new sources of green energy around Britain and support over 59,000 homes, businesses and communities generating their own green electricity. Plus, they’ve been voted top of the Which? customer satisfaction survey for energy suppliers three years running, so you can be sure you’re getting top notch service. All this and it’s still cheaper than the standard dual fuel tariffs offered by the Big Six suppliers. Switch to Good Energy quoting GE2237 and help transform the way we make and use energy in the UK.
