TERMS PAYMENT Payment may be made by VISA, MASTERCARD and AMERICAN EXPRESS, or by cheque in any major currency. Non-UK Sterling cheques drawn on a foreign bank are subject to a conversion charge of $10.00   All items offered are subject to being unsold at the time of your order. Prices are Net to all. SHIPPING Postage is charged extra, as close as possible to actual cost. Great care is taken in packing to ensure that all items arrive at their destination in the same condition as sent. Most orders are shipped within 2 business days. Domestic orders are usually sent via Recorded or Special Delivery. Heavy packages are likely to be sent via parcel post, unless other arrangements have been made. For international orders, the actual cost of shipping and insurance (where required) will be charged separately to your credit card after the order has been sent. This allows for the exact amount to be charged rather than an estimate (due to variations in weight, size, value and destination country, the cost of international shipments can vary greatly). The order confirmation email you receive will not include this additional charge, but where possible I will notify customers with the total amount charged once the order has shipped. FedEx is also available for international orders. RETURNS Every attempt is made to describe each item carefully and accurately, and all items are guaranteed as described. Any item considered to be not as described may be returned within 7 days of receipt, provided it's in original condition and prior notification is given. LIBRARIES AND INSTITUTIONS Libraries and institutions may arrange deferred billing on request.
