August 2011
The Family Budget Unit has decided to dissolve itself. The
trustees made this decision unanimously at a meeting on July 1 2011. The
appropriate notice has been sent to the Registrar of Companies.
In accordance with clause 7 of the Companies memorandum of
Association on the dissolution of a company after the payment of all debts and
liabilities the surplus funds have been transferred to the Zacchaeus 2000 Trust http://www.z2k.org/ because it has similar
objectives to the FBU.
The intellectual property of the FBU has been transferred to
the Minimum Income Standards project http://www.minimumincomestandard.org/ at the University of Loughborough who, with the support of the Joseph Rowntree
Foundation http://www.jrf.org.uk/, Â continue to research and publish budget
standards.
This website will remain open for the time-being because it
contains links to FBU publications. These are in the process of being archived
in the British Library.
