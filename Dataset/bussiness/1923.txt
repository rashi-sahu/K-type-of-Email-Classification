Towards a thriving metadata ecosystem
The JISC -funded Discovery programme was launched in May 2011 to create 'a metadata ecology' to support better access to vital collections data in libraries,
archives and museums and facilitate new services for UK education and research.
Our work will continue to the end of 2012 and is focused on advocating open data, reducing technical and licensing barriers, providing information, advice and training,
and supporting exemplars.
The Discovery programme takes forward the Vision of the earlier JISC and RLUK Resource Discovery Taskforce (RDTF) which has been working with partners from the libraries,
archives and museums since 2010.
