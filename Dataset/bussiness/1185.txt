Pure only tend to provide quality candidates. They listen to a hiring manager's requirements and will only recommend those who are relevant - and if there is a candidate a little out of the ordinary, they will justify their reasons as opposed to sending a large volume of CVs. I think I have hired through Pure at least four times, and all recruits have been successful long-term employees.

I have been really pleased with the support Pure have given us. The two recent additions to the team have done exactly what I hoped for they have helped us raise our game, have improved the team and our getting great feedback from the business. Thank you.

You seek the time to understand the team along with the requirements of role and always try to understand personality fit. You vet the CVs before sending them across to ensure they are tailored to the requirements rather than sending a raft of CVs over. If you are struggling
to find candidates you take the time to update and discuss what you feel will help, whether its salary or a bit more flexibility around qualification or previous experience.

We recently used Pure to recruit for a crucial role in a very busy Department, they not only sourced one superb candidate but two and both were ideal fits. Pure totally understood our requirements and we will not hesitate to use them again.
