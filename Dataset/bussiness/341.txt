Views on UKSIF
“I am delighted to be hosting the Ownership Day Parliamentary Reception this year. UKSIF’s campaign is vitally important to ensuring that asset owners, such as pension funds, engage with companies on issues which could impact their long-term financial returns.  Effective use of shareholder power is key to protecting the value of people’s pensions and savings and I would urge everyone – policymakers, pension funds and the public – to get involved in Ownership Day”.
