Welcome to the CIOT
The CIOT is the leading professional body in the UK for advisers dealing with all aspects of taxation. As a not-for-profit organisation our primary purpose is to promote education in taxation with a key aim of achieving a more efficient and less complex tax system for all. Our comments and recommendations on tax issues are made solely in order to achieve this aim; we are a non-party-political organisation.
The Institute itself does not provide tax advice. Our members may provide such advice and other tax services as tax professionals. The only exception to this is our Low Incomes Tax Reform Group who publish a wealth of information for the unrepresented taxpayer. Membership of the CIOT is by examination nationally recognised as the gold standard of UK taxation education. Our 18,000 Chartered Tax Adviser members are subject to the Institute's professional standards and are supported by our London head office and worldwide network of 40 branches.
The CIOT is a registered charity, number 1037771.
