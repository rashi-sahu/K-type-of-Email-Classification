“We were delighted by the work done by Prospect Research. Using an outsourced telemarketing company to follow-up our e-shot, we were able to increase our return from the campaign significantly.”
Cambridge University Press
We initially commissioned the telemarketing services of Prospect for a one-off event. It then became apparent that our database required wholesale cleansing,  a job that was simply too big for us to take on. Being able to outsource this vital but time-consuming work to Prospect has added huge value to our business engagement activities and enabled us to concentrate on other core projects knowing it was in safe hands. They have been an absolute pleasure to work with, especially Connor Dunn who went the ‘extra mile’ on countless occasions to meet all our requirements. We highly recommend them.
Hertfordshire Local Enterprise Partnership
“A thoroughly professional service which has yielded impressive results.”
