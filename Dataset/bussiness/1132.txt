Paul Gans - Plant Health Management
Integrated Crop Management
Good Plant Health Management is based on a comprehensive knowledge
of the factors which affect pests, diseases and physiology of the crop.
These in turn determine the yield and quality of crops.
Farm profitability must go hand in hand with sustainability and
care for the environment.
It is only through an integrated approach
and an understanding of the demands of the market place that we can
hope to achieve the right balance.
Dr Paul Gans has studied nematodes, fungi, bacteria,
virus as well as the physiological factors which affect the
potato crop over many years. He has conducted variety pest
and disease resistance trials, diagnostic tests, pesticide
efficacy trials and related R&D.
