Black Welsh Mountain Sheep Breeders' Association
Black Welsh Mountain are an easy to manage small breed with a natural resistance to disease. They will graze well on rough grazing but are also happy on the lowlands or a smallholding.
They are prolific and undemanding, hardy and self-reliant. They produce premium quality, lean meat with an excellent meat to bone ratio and a full flavour.
