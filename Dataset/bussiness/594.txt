DEVELOPING A catheter coating To PREVENT INFECTION and reduce ASSOCIATED costs
drug-free resistance to biofilm development on medical device surfaces
Opt in to stay informed:
Hospital acquired infections are one of the biggest problems facing global healthcare
Millions of patients catch infections from their hospital stay every year, prolonging the time they spend in hospital and costing many of them their lives.
These infections cost healthcare systems around the world billions in unplanned care, increased medication and congested waiting lists.
The biggest cause of these infections are urinary catheters used during inpatient treatment.  Read more >
A step change of strategy to prevent catheter related HAIs
Unlike silver and antibiotic eluting technologies, Camstent’s coating doesn’t attempt to kill bacteria but create a 'non-stick' surface that resists bacteria colonisation.
By preventing bacteria from attaching to the catheters used during treatment, biofilm development is inhibited, potentially protecting patients from developing an infection.
The coating may be applied to standard Foley catheters during manufacture, potentially offering a cost-effective solution to a significant healthcare problem.  Read more >
Camstent’s coating is bacteria-phobic
Our technology employs molecules that resist bacterial attachment, polymerised over surfaces as secure coatings. This process yields catheters that may inhibit bacterial biofilm formation without killing microorganisms. Useful variations can also be created that may resist blood and protein attachment.
The Camstent bacteria-phobic coating does not contribute to bacterial resistance, requires no delivery system, and remains intact and effective throughout normal use of the catheter.  Read more >

"I feel we have an exciting opportunity to make a real difference in tackling hospital-acquired infections. Our coating acts as a 'non-stick' surface for bacteria and is a fundamental technology advance in preventing Catheter Associated Urinary Tracts Infections (CAUTIs)."
