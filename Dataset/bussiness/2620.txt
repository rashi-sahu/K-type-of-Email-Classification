UK Steel
EEF propels bottom-line success and innovation, serving as the voice of UK manufacturing to government, media and abroad.
Through our business support services, we ensure our manufacturers are competitive, sustainable and future-focused. Our members-only discounts, events and advice keep manufacturers compliant, safe and efficient.
Our policy team not only campaigns on behalf of manufacturing, but releases regular studies, reports and insider news on vital industry issues. From our state-of-the-art training centre to sites across the UK, our certified experts deliver training courses, which can be tailored to the needs (and locations) of individual businesses.
