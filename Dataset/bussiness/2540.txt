Campaign Update
Nuclear Industry’s Dead Cat Bounce
We urgently need a Plan B for UK Energy Policy, says Nick Butler in the Financial Times. With Toshiba and Engie likely to withdraw from the Moorside project the UK’s plans to make new nuclear the core of future energy supply has a serious problem. Hinkley Point and Sizewell are both still in doubt because a new French government after elections in May could decide that subsidies to EDF are unsustainable. EDF is deeply indebted and its finances have …

Nuclear companies struggle with finances but solar is fast becoming the cheapest form of power everywhere
The three companies seeking to build new nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point, Sizewell, Moorside, Wylfa and Oldbury are under growing financial pressure, raising doubts about whether the UK’s nuclear renaissance will ever get off the starting blocks.
The French nuclear regulator – ASN – has been investigating a growing nuclear scandal in France involving steel components made at Areva’s Le Creusot factory which have been found to contain excessive carbon levels which could make them vulnerable to cracking. There is also …

Don’t Buy Nuclear Waste
Now that Theresa May has (to steal some of the best sound-bites from the last few days) decided (1) to build a better yesterday with a safari park of white elephants – it’s time to shift the discussion from the huge cost of Hinkley Point C and the security implications of allowing the Chinese to get involved in building nuclear power stations in the UK to what we could all gain if these reactors ever get built.
In brief, spent nuclear …

Moorside
The future of Moorside, one of Britain’s three big nuclear projects, was thrown into doubt last night after it emerged that cash-strapped Toshiba and its partner Engie needed to find £225 million in the next two years to fund its preparation. The Cumbrian project was set to be approved at the end of next year, to join Hinkley Point C in Somerset and Wylfa in North Wales as the nuclear alternative to coal and gas. Toshiba has said it will …

Sizewell
A Suffolk MP believes much more needs to be done to mitigate the expected impact of traffic on communities across the east of the county if the Sizewell C nuclear power station is built.

New Nuclear
The government’s plans to quit the Euratom treaty pose a fresh threat to the UK’s increasingly embattled nuclear new build programme, a new report has warned. The study, issued by the Institute of Mechanical Engineers says that the government’s plans to exit the treaty could imperil fuel supplies, jeopardising energy security as well as threatening plans to build new nuclear reactors and decommissioning activities. Former energy secretary of state Sir Ed Davey told Utility Week last week that withdrawal …
