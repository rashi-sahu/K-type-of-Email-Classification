Fresh food and friendly faces
That's what makes us Morrisons
Drawing on our rich heritage as a community grocer, our foodmakers and shopkeepers are committed to serving up quality products and everyday value that we're all proud to put our name to - with a friendly, fresh-focused shopping experience you won't find anywhere else.
Free Range Eggs & Chicken
Animal welfare is a top priority. To limit the spread of Avian Flu, the Government has implemented control measures that require all poultry to be kept indoors.
Although this means that free range chickens are temporarily being kept in barns and are therefore not able to roam outside, all other elements of their higher welfare standards are being maintained. We nonetheless need to let you know that all our food labelled as free range egg or chicken, or containing them as ingredients, is currently affected by these temporary measures.
At the moment, keeping birds indoors is really important to support British farming and ensure the welfare of our chickens.
Avian Flu does not pose a Food Safety risk. We will keep you updated of any changes.
