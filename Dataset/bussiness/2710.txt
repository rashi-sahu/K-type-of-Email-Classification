Analysis of a new delivery peak trend
08/02/2017
In 2016, we recorded a notable shift in the IMRG MetaPack Delivery Index over the peak Christmas trading period. The month-on-month order volume growth between November and December 2016 was just +4.5% – far lower than the equivalent in 2015.
Online fashion: customer retention rates still lag
15/02/2017
Looking at our latetst data, active retention rates for the clothing sector are lagging behind the rate for total online retail. What are the factors behind this trend and is there anything retailers can do to improve?
What can retailers learn from the growth in active customer retention?
31/01/2017
We’ve seen a 67% increase in online retail customer retention rates in the last 6 years. This trend, while remarkable, is perhaps not surprising. If a retailer can persuade existing customers to keep buying, the purchases that follow don’t come with the margin-eating cost-per-acquisition of new customers.
