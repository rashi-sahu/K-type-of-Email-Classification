We connect products wirelessly
Since 2007 we've been working with our clients to add wireless connectivity to their products, from gas detection to animal healthcare we specialise in getting signals out of difficult environments. We can help withWireless ConnectivityOur main experience is in connecting products together wirelessly, our customers usually have a difficult problem to solve and whether it's getting a radio signal out of a cow's stomach or through the main body of a steam engine, if it's physically possible, we can build it.Product DevelopmentWhen developing a new product which needs to communicate wirelessly, we have the knowledge and experience to help you make the right choice, we've all made the mistake of believing a manufacturers spec sheet, thankfully our knowledge is based on the experience of having used the technologies and not based on what we've been told.
