Richmond MGMT - Urban Congestion - RSML Planning Consultancy
OBJECTIVE:
Richmond Management is a professional management group, which seeks to
locate, & invest, in a company in the technology sector (not retail market).
The system, or
product, would be unique.
If the system could be patented that would be ideal, although
not essential.
One example, software, with experienced management, & funding,
could
create a highly successful operation.
The new management direction would be to offset the
current problems noted below.
ENTREPRENEURIAL ECONOMIC
SITUATION
(1) 70% OF NEW TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS FAIL TO REACH THE ABOVE BUSINESS STAGE!
(2) THE COMPANY WEBSITE, A MAJOR FACTOR, ATTRACTS ONLY 10% OF THE NEW CLIENTS.
The above results clearly are a limit on the economy, & on the many companies involved.
RMG uses the following management experience to improve the performance with both
new & established technology companies, which includes:
(1)
STRATEGY  PRELIMINARY CREATIVE PLANNING WITH WEBSITE DESIGN, to reflect the major applications
FUNDING 
Business Case To justify further investment.
CHANGE MANAGEMENT, based on results. (turn-around management if necessary).
RESULTS: RMG HAS expanded 10 technology companies successfully, using the creative approach!
(2)
BUSINESS NETWORK ESTABLISHED: (comprising investors, small & large technology companies).
- U.K., Europe, (West & Eastern)
- CANADA (ENTRÉE TO U.S.)
(3)
FUNDING: Further to immediate funding, major funding for expansion would utilize the RMG business
experience to attract funding.
For international expansion, RMG could use the above network, plus
the M & A project method, to speed expansion, for an established technology company.
MAJOR PROJECT MANAGEMENT: RMG IS INTERESTED IN MANAGING MAJOR
TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS, WHICH THE FOLLOWING PROJECTS
ILLUSTRATE. SOME PROJECTS REQUIRE 10 YEARS OF ADVANCE PLANNING.
ITS TRANSPORTATION PROJECT PLANNING:
Richmond Management specializes in the preliminary planning of projects for control of urban transportation. We work with the Mayor regarding future plans for urban transportation, and with the traffic management team to develop the overall traffic plan, typically with a 10 year traffic forecast as a strategy. This would involve system strategy, with assistance on specifications for system suppliers. This would include the testing involved, during the system installation, and final total system testing. Specific systems are shown below.
