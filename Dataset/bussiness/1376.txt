How
can we help you?
We help
private and public sector clients solve business
and technology issues related to automation, communication, media, cyber-security or technology.
In
the private sector, we help companies and
organisations at all stages of development from
preparation to start-up, via revenue-generating SME, first stepping
internationals to value-optimising international
conglomerate.
In
the public sector, we help organsations
apply technology more effectively in support of
intended process change.
A speciality is
helping companies develop internationally,
especially in and from UK where we can help
companies identify and establish business and
technology partnerships and customers or
investors. We understand the drivers and
trends that will create opportunites and threats
for your organisation over the coming years.
Balancing cost, outcome and timescale is
non-trivial, especially in the specification,
procurement and implementation or even rescue of complex, innovative
systems projects.
We advise on the
opportunities and threats presented by new
technologies from big data, cloud,
cyber-security, e-commerce and the Internet of
Things to social media.
Founded
by Frank Morris, Vecta
focuses on your business plan and "cash/cost
chain" to ensure that marketing and
development investments are balanced and fully
aligned with a sensible strategy for the
business. We can also look at individual
projects, whether to rescue or restructure them
for maximum value.
