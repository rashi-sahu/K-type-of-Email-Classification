PENCUBITT HOUSE near Liskeard in Cornwall really is an ideal location for exploring South East Cornwall and Devon. We are really close to Bodmin and Bodmin Moor and the local fishing villages of Looe and Polperro. The harbour towns of Fowey and Mevagissey, The Eden Project and The Lost Gardens of Heligan, and Country Houses like Lanhydrock and Cotehele are also very nearby. Dartmoor, Plymouth and The Tamar Valley are not far and a day trip to Padstow is less than an hour away - the choice is yours! You really can use us as a base to see it all.

Our former Victorian Wool Merchant’s Residence (brief history of the house) features nine individually decorated and comfortable rooms together with a relaxing guest lounge and licensed bar where you’ll find all day complimentary tea & coffee. Here you can read from our collection of informative and interesting books, catch up on emails, or simply enjoy a drink from the bar whilst overlooking the garden views and the beautiful rolling countryside of the Looe Valley. You won’t want to leave.
We serve a traditional and hearty breakfast to set you up for your day!
We also serve a pre-ordered home-cooked dinner menu offering traditional fayre from smoked salmon and parfait starters, slow-cooked lamb shanks and pork belly main courses to homemade apple pie and local ice cream desserts. All finished off with freshly brewed tea or coffee.
Our aim is to ensure you enjoy your stay with us in our relaxing and comfortable character home.
We look forward to meeting you and welcoming you into our home at Pencubitt.
