Client FeedbackSee what our clients say about working with COEL…
“COEL were happy to take charge of both design (including furnishings) and execution which in practice worked very well. There were just 9 weeks between our being given access to a bare shell to being handed the keys by COEL of a fully functional office.
The project was completed without fuss, on time.  It was a highly successful operation and the level of organisation was extremely impressive.”

“COMSOL Ltd has now used COEL to design and build two new offices. They were selected for our recent move on the basis of past performance and we were not disappointed. They were prepared to work with us extensively on the design phase in order to achieve the solution we wanted.
The fit out delivery went smoothly and the quality of the work and material used was very high. We are delighted with our new office and I would not hesitate to recommend COEL.”
Director
Comsol, Cambridge
“The design, thought, planning and approach from COEL has been impressive. From the initial consultations through to the delivery of the project we’d felt that we had input where we wanted it but that everything was being managed by an incredibly competent team.
The end result has been impressive – our staff love it and so do our clients (the first client through the door took lots of pictures). We’ve now got a collaborative environment that suits our business needs perfectly.”
CCO
Crafted, Ipswich
“We thoroughly enjoyed working with the teams at COEL on this job. Everyone was fully engaged in the project and we received such a high level of customer service, support, communication from everyone involved.
The design team worked with us to create and deliver a truly inspiring result and the furniture team helped us to source products that not only met with our design ideas but also our environmental principles.”
