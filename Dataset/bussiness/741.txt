Design Management
The Strategic and Operational Management of Design
Our Design Management group is concerned with helping companies to better manage their design activities at both a strategic and an operational level. The research we have undertaken in this area has explored the challenges that companies must overcome to properly benefit from product and service innovation. We use this knowledge to help companies through direct engagement and through the support programmes that we run.
In 2000, PDR established Design Wales, an operation dedicated to support services for businesses and regional development offices.  Our Design Wales activity aimed to help businesses realise the direct benefits of design and to point the way to a more sustainable Welsh Economy. Today these activities are intergrated into our broader Design Management capabilities, where we assist companies and organisations in many countries on the management of design through various funded programmes and consultancy.
