The Organic Food Federation
Welcome to The Organic Food Federation GB-ORG-04
The Organic Food Federation is at the forefront of promoting organic methods and maintaining high standards and best practice within the sector. New exciting opportunities for the UK’s organic producers, processors, traders and importers have been created due to the rising demand for organic products.
If you are involved in any way with the production, processing, warehousing / storage, trading or importing of organic produce we can help. Our services will enable you to achieve official organic certification status for your product, safe in the knowledge that our dedicated team will guide you through the process.
This site is full of information including an introduction to our service, benefits of registration and a great download centre where useful free guidance is available. When you have finished browsing these pages, if you require further assistance, please call us and we will be happy to help.
