Factory Information System
The Rhombus Factory Information System is a modular production control system for piece-part manufacturers.
It is unusual in that it has been built up from a shop-floor data collection system, rather than down from an accounting system. This means that it has modules to handle many tasks on the shop-floor which you do not get in other software packages.
Large companies use it for machine monitoring, OEE measurement, quality control and material traceability.
Small and medium sized companies use it to run their businesses.
Whether you want a simple tool to improve the performance of a single production line, or want a worldwide integrated Factory Information System, Rhombus Systems can provide it.
