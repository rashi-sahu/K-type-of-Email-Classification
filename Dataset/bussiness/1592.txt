Welcome to The Corner House website
The Corner House aims to support democratic and community movements for environmental and social justice. We aim to pay constant attention to issues of social, economic and political power and practical strategy.
As part of our solidarity work, The Corner House carries out analyses, research and advocacy with the aim of linking issues, of stimulating informed discussion and strategic thought on critical environmental and social concerns, and of encouraging broad alliances to tackle them.
