Cardiff Central is the nearest station to the Stadium and operates mainline services from West Wales, the Midlands, the South Coast and London. Cardiff Queen Street Station is a 15 minute walk to the east of the Stadium and offers local rail services across Cardiff and from the South Wales Valleys.
A queuing system is generally in operation at Cardiff Central Station after each event so please check the Arriva Trains website before travelling for further information. When arriving from Cardiff Central station passengers should bear left along Wood Street for Gates 5, 6 and 7 or bear right along Wood Street to Westgate Street for Gates 4, 3, 2 continuing around to Gate 1 on Castle Street.
You can travel to Cardiff by coach from most UK cities including London, Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle and Edinburgh. There are also with regular buses services between most town/cities in Wales if you staying outside of Cardiff.
Cardiff Central Bus Station is a five minute walk from the stadium, passengers exit the bus station and bear left along Wood Street for Gates 5, 6 and 7 or bear right along Wood Street to Westgate Street for Gates 4, 3, 2 continuing around to Gate 1 on Castle Street. Coach parking on event days is usually located at Sophia Gardens which is just a five minute walk away, following the river.
Cardiff's location on the M4 corridor makes it easily accessible by car and is within two hours drive of London and the East Midlands. There is no dedicated spectator car parking at, or near, the stadium or matches days but there is plenty of parking available in the City Center itself.
We would advise spectators take advantage of the Park and Rides available on events days located at Pentwyn and Leckwith. You book these locations and others in advance by clicking here.
Please note that this link will take you through to the website www.parkjockey.com which is run by Park Jockey London Limited and which is independent of Principality Stadium.
If you live in or are staying in Cardiff then walking to the stadium may be your best option as local transport systems can be very busy on event days. If you are staying in Cardiff Bay you can also take a boat taxi to the City Centre.
