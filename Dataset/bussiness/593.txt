Welcome to Cam Trade Marks & IP Services
Intellectual Property (IP) Rights are private rights that are there for
the benefit of your business. Some of these rights are given to you
automatically, others require a registration process. Not to know about
these rights - yours and others in your field - could make the difference
between business success and failure.
Cam Trade Marks & IP Services provides its clients with a comprehensive range of legal
and commercial IP-related
services, with a special focus on trade marks, to help your business make
the most of the IP system, in the UK and elsewhere.
Award winning
The firm's exceptional service to clients and success has been recognised through six independent awards in 2013 and 2014 for 'Trade mark law firm of the year' in England.
