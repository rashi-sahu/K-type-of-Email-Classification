About Us
Impulse Point Of Purchase was established in 2005 by Mark McKeown. After many successful years in the POS industry in Design, Manufacturing and Operations, Mark had a very clear vision of what he wanted Impulse to stand for within the POS industry.
Working with a team of trusted and knowledgeable designers, engineers, client service mangers and manufacturing personnel, Impulse quickly established its reputation as a company that could design, engineer, produce and deliver what their clients wanted. Excellence in Retail!
Being a Full Service Provider is key to Impulses’ success and with a UK based manufacturing plant capable of supplying quickly and efficiently in a wide range of materials including metal, wood and acrylic as well as extremely cost effective partnership arrangements to supply plastic mouldings and cardboard displays, Impulse continues to build its reputation in various key market sectors.
With a wide range of contacts and experience in the Music, Entertainment, DIY, Fashion and Travel markets in particular, Impulse offer their clients a fully integrated design and manufacturing solution.
Working with some of the most recognizable High Street Brands and Retailers, Impulse’s continued success depends on its ability to be able to offer displays across the entire retail display spectrum.
Temporary and Permanent Retail Displays as well as Store – In -Store, Pop-Up, Event and Exhibition Display Stands are all within the Impulse teams in-house capabilities.
We can offer advice, research, training days and background knowledge in the design, engineering and manufacture of a wide range of relevant and suitable in-store displays for Brands and Retailers alike.
