Welcome to CLIP - the Crew List Index Project
CLIP was set up to improve access to the records of British merchant
seafarers of the late 19th century and has gathered the largest
database of entries from crew lists. This site gives information about:
what crew lists are;
the Crew List Index Project (CLIP);
how to find the original documents and the seafarers on them;
indexes of seafarers including the
CLIP data, and
CLIP finding aids;
CLIP projects on the records of shipping and seafarers.
The CLIP crew name index is available online at
findmypast
NB! CLIP is confined to merchant seafarers on British
registered ships for the years 1861 to 1913.
This site provides guidance and finding aids to help
you carry out your own research.
Sorry, we are not able to carry out privately commissioned research or provide transcripts or copies of crew lists.
