About Us
The group exists to promote sustainable energy issues in Parliament and the wider political community
Welcome to the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Renewable and Sustainable Energy
PRASEG, the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Renewable and Sustainable Energy, is the cross party group for UK politicians and senior industry stakeholders that exists to promote sustainable energy issues in Parliament and the wider political community.
We hold regular events in Westminster to discuss the strategic national and international policy developments that shape the deployment of sustainable energy including renewables, energy efficiency and combined heat and power. We have over 130 parliamentary members and 100 industry members.
The All-Party Parliamentary Group for Renewable and Sustainable Energy is supported by an independent, not-for-profit NGO, PRASEG ltd.
