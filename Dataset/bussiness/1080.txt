Welcome to NW Brown
As one of the leading financial services groups in East Anglia we provide expert, bespoke, professional advice to personal and corporate clients in the Eastern region and beyond. Whilst all our clients are different, they all enjoy the benefits that only truly independent advice can bring. We are able to cover the entire market and have the ability to access a complete range of investment options, products and advice.
At NW Brown you will find all the knowledge and expertise you need to help you achieve your financial objectives. Whether it is to create a bespoke investment strategy, an employee benefit programme or to find the right pension or mortgage product, we take the time to understand what you need and to provide solutions that are realistic and cost-effective.
Working from offices in Cambridge and Norwich, we pride ourselves on our ability to provide sensible advice and management. We can do this because the business is independently owned. We are used to putting the interests of the clients first.
