Welcome to the World Renewable Energy Congress - WREN
Introduction to Renewable Energy
Med Green Forum Organisers
The world population in the year 2100 will be in excess of 12 billion. If the current trends in technological progress and innovation continue, the demand for energy then will be five times greater than what it is now. If we continue the policy of using coal, oil and gas at the present rate, then by the year 2020 the global temperature will have increased by two degrees Celsius. We do not need reminding of the adverse effects of this: the increased risk of flooding in lowland areas, the processes of desertification, and changing climate all over the world.
It is a known fact that at the present moment renewable energy contributes only 11% to our primary energy. If we intend to do something about our planet, to safeguard our future and to create a healthy environment for the generations to come, then we must all actively utilize renewable energy in our daily life. It is expected that 60% of all our energy will come from renewable energy by the year 2070. The sooner we employ the attitude that today is better than tomorrow, the greater the opportunity to increase this figure to 80%. The World Solar Summit, World Solar Decade and the World Bank have recently allocated overÂ four billion dollars to projects dealing with renewable energy and the environment. This clearly demonstrates the importance of renewable energy as the new source of power for the future.
About the World Renewable Energy Congress / Network (WREC/WREN)
WREN is a major non-profit organization registered in the United Kingdom with charitable status and affiliated to UNESCO,
the Deputy Director General of which is its honorary President. It has a
Governing Council, an Executive Committee and a Director General. It
maintains links with many United Nations, governmental and
non-governmental organisations.
Established in 1992 during the second World Renewable Energy
Congress in Reading, UK, WREN is one of the most effective
organizations in supporting and enhancing the utilisation and
implementation of renewable energy sources that are both environmentally
safe and economically sustainable. This is done through a worldwide
network of agencies, laboratories, institututions, companies and
individuals, all working together towards the international diffusion of
renewable energy technologies and applications. Representing most
countries in the world, it aims to promote the communication and
technical education of scientists, engineers, technicians and managers
in this field and to address itself to the energy needs of both
developing and developed countries.
Over two billion dollars have now been allocated to projects
dealing with renewable energy and the environment by the World Solar
Summit and World Solar Decade along with the World Bank. This shows that
at last the important message is being heard. The renewable energy
community has exhibited a lot of courage, stamina and willpower,
demonstrating renewable energy to be a viable energy provider. We should
continue at a faster pace.
