Ministers' Metrication
Conspiracy
The proof that compulsory
metrication arose from an EC Directive in 1971, and not a decision taken
domestically in 1965 by the UK government
Under Britain's
new constitution, ministers may use the 1972 European Communities Act to repeal
future legislation. This includes the 1985 Weights and Measures Act that
permits pounds and ounces.
The Metric Martyrs (above) are traders who have been convicted under
the 1972 Act for using pounds and ounces, despite lb/oz being legal under the
more recent 1985 Act.
Why BWMA says pounds and ounces are still
lawful

Consumer Affairs
Spot the difference: quantities
have shrunk to smaller metric sizes while prices have stayed
constant
Business issues
Retailers are
under threat of criminal prosecution if they use imperial weights and
measures
Transport and
Signs
Metric signs, although commonplace, are against the
law
International Trade
US metric conversion plans are on hold; EC plans to prohibit
"supplementary indications" are suspended - for now
