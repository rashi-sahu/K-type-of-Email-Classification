About Us
At Camel Valley, we’ve been producing award-winning, world-class wines in a beautiful corner of Cornwall since 1989.
What is it that makes our wines so good? It’s really quite simple – an idyllic setting on sun-drenched slopes near the famous Camel River; excellent grapes that perfectly suit the soil and climate; a respect for traditional vineyard practices combined with a modern approach to wine making and, most importantly, a passion for creating wines that provide pure pleasure...
Why not enjoy the view from our terrace, where we serve wine by the glass?

Our unique tours are relaxed and friendly and the location is stunning; sitting on the terrace sipping Camel Valley wine on a summer’s afternoon is magical.
