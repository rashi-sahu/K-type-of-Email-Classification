Welcome to Fordhall FarmProud to be community owned
What is Fordhall Farm?
Fordhall Organic Farm, in Market Drayton, north Shropshire is England’s first community owned farm and has been organic for over 65 years – we offer a warm welcome to all.
Our tenant farmer Ben rears grass fed beef, lamb and Gloucester Old Spot pork. Owned by a charitable community-benefit society, our farm is open to the public as an enjoyable and educational resource year round.
Fordhall Farm led the way in organic farming after the war, pioneered British yoghurt production in the 1950’s, and after being saved from development in 2006 through a pioneering national campaign, it is now owned by over 8000 community shareholders.
We are open year round to the public as well as offering free farm trails, organic café, group tours, glamping in our yurts, educational visits, events, courses, weddings, meeting room space, care farming and volunteering opportunities… phew! And, as you delve into our website you will find there is a lot more to the Fordhall story… happy surfing!
Farm Shop and Arthur’s Farm Kitchen: Tues – Sat 9.30am – 5.00pm and Sun 10.00am – 4.00pm. Open Bank Holiday Mondays 10.00am – 4.00pm.
To receive a welcome direct from Ben and Charlotte Hollins, listen to this .mp3 (recorded by them in 2009)
