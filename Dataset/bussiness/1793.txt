﻿﻿Welcome to Real Lettings ﻿﻿﻿
Real Lettings is a social lettings service set up in 2005 to help secure homes for vulnerably housed and homeless people in the private sector. Over the years, we have helped hundreds of tenants and families to escape their cycle of homelessness. For many of the people we work with, Real Lettings has proven to be their only access to quality and affordable, private sector accommodation.
