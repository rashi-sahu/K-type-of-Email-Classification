Durham in Time Home Page
Durham has a unique heritage built upon
its natural resources and its people.
It is a county of contrast
with a diverse landscape and strong industrial and agricultural
heritage.
Roman invasion and settlement, the rise in Christianity
through to industrialisation have made the Land of the Prince Bishops
what it is today.
For the first time visitor to County
Durham there is little visual evidence of the past industrial
heritage which was at the heart of the county and its people.
Although the coal mines and many of the heavy industries have now
gone that heritage lives on through the local history collections
held by local societies and community groups around the county.
The Durham in
Time project, funded by the Heritage Lottery
Fund, will provide the opportunity for societies and
community heritage groups throughout County Durham to record and
digitise their local history collections. The story of our heritage
will be told via new community websites and the Durham in Time
on-line community archive.
