*From 2p per mile is based on (i) overnight electricity costs (British Gas standard tariff rates for a customer paying by direct debit as at 1st February 2016, assuming seven hours of charging at the night rate and one hour on the day rate), (ii) 95% charging efficiency, and (iii) a range of 124 miles per full charge for the 24kWh model (based on New European Driving Cycle) or a range of 155 miles for the 30kWh model (based on New European Driving Cycle). Range figures are obtained from laboratory testing and intended for comparisons between vehicles and may not reflect real driving results. Actual consumption and range may vary due to driving style, road condition, air conditioning and other factors outside our control. Daily standing charge of 26p also applies. Relates solely to the cost of the electricity used to charge the LEAF and takes no account of any other costs associated with running/owning the vehicle.
