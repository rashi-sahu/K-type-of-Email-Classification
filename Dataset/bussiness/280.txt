Accountancy & Book-Keeping Service Cambridge
PMC Accounting Services Limited is small, friendly and professional. I offer accountancy and book-keeping services to small businesses and individuals in and around Cambridge.
When you know that your books are being neglected it can feel like a time bomb ticking away in the background of your business. You know you're going to have to get to grips with it but the longer you leave it the worse it gets. Show me a desk overflowing with invoices, VAT returns and bank statements and I'm in my element. I manage your accounts while you manage your business!
Every client receives one-to-one service tailored to their needs. So whether you are looking for someone to set up office accounting systems, look after your book-keeping or deal with VAT, payroll and tax I can help.
Don't struggle with your tax returns or become overwhelmed by VAT regulations. Why not save yourself time and money? Get in touch with me today.
