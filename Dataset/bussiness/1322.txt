Our History
About Us
About us
The Technology Partnership was established over 25 years ago to create a world-leading technology and development organisation. Today that enterprise has evolved and grown into TTP Group, a range of businesses focussed on meeting the needs of companies planning to flourish through the use of technology and innovation.
In keeping with the origins, the Group's companies have evolved and continue to develop break-through new products, apply the latest innovations and in many cases develop new technology to meet commercial needs.
As the enterprise has grown, new companies have been created, some of which have remained within TTP Group, while others have been sold, demerged or floated on the London Stock Exchange.
