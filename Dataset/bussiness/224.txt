Welcome to Isitfair
Isitfair was started in October 2002 by Christine and John Melsom as a local action
group in Hampshire.  They were incensed about the proposed huge increase in Council
Tax bills for the year 2003/04.  This was the year when the average increase was
12.9%!  Although the Government at that time knew that this was going to happen,
they did absolutely nothing to prevent it.  Instead, they blamed the local councils!
Isitfair believes that the current council tax system is unfair, being based on property
values as opposed to peoples' ability to pay.  At the end of the day, despite the arguments
for and against this system, properties do not pay this tax, it is the occupants of
the property that pay it, and not necessarily all of them.

Local Government Finance Settlement 2017-18: Technical Consulation
Published on 15 September, this consultation seeks views on:
The Distribution of Central Resources
Changes to Local Resources
Under Changes to Local Resources section 3.3, the Government is proposing to introduce
council tax referendum principles for parish and town councils under certain conditions.
This is something that Isitfair has been campaigning for for many years now. Click
here to read more.
According to this document, the average Band D increase for the tax year 2016-17 is a
whopping 6.1%.  The basic rule for determining if a parish or town council should
be subject to referendum principles is:
The Band D precept is higher than that of the lowest charging district council for 2016-17 (£75.46),
and the total precept for 2016-17 is at least £500,000.
There are additional conditions where a transfer of responsibilities has taken place.
Now is the time for you to have your say
The consulation can be downloaded from the DGLG website here:
Local government finance settlement 2017 to 2018: technical consultation.
We know from your feedback that many of you are suffering from significant increases
in your town and parish precepts this year. It is therefore important
that you get involved with this consultation and give feedback.  This consultation
closes on 28 October so you need to respond as soon as possible.  These inflation
busting increases must be stopped.
Don't be fooled by the disingenous claim in paragraph 3.2.1:
Government is committed to keeping council tax low and, under the existing principles,
the average Band D increase for 2016/17 was 3.1%, which means that council tax is still
9% lower in real terms than it was in 2009/10.
This completely ignores the previous years when council tax increases were always higher
than inflation.  What the public sector needs to understand is that it cannot just
carry on increasing council tax year on year.  It needs to understand that council
tax payers don't have bottomless pockets that they can dip into.

George Osborne's Autumn Statement 25 November 2015
Council tax payers were hit with a new 2% precept on top of their usual tax bills to
help fund the cost of local social care.  The LGA have estimated that Band D bills
could cost an average of just under £200 more over the next five years.
We believe that the cost of social care should be paid for through general taxation,
just like the NHS.  Why should council tax payers only have to pay for
the cost of failing to fund social care properly?  Is it fair?    How
many times have we heard this Chancellor stand up and say that everyone should pay their
fair share of taxes?  Then there's "We're all in this together."
Except that is, if you are a council tax payer.  The Chancellor has shirked his
responsibilities to the vulnerable and most needy in our society, put up council tax
for hard working families and left it to the local authorities to sort out the mess that
he has created through his austerity measures.  So much for being a compassionate
conservative.
If you feel as aggrieved as we do and would like to make your feelings known, then we
have some contact details for you and further information.
