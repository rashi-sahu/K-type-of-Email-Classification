Cakes
We believe they should look beautiful and taste amazing. Our approach to creating cakes is very straightforward – we use the best available ingredients: organic fruit, vegetables, eggs and Shipton Mill flour, fair trade sugar, cocoa and coffee and natural butter.
These are all chosen because they are products we love to bake with – and like to eat!
All cakes, cupcakes and biscuits are designed, baked and decorated to order. Each product is unique, delicious and is handmade in our kitchen with great care and attention to detail.
