House Borgonha
"I knew Baufritz or nothing. The quality of living, the healthy build, the energy efficiency, the individual design where not every house looks the same, these were reasons enough."

House Patel
"Building a home means dealing with people. We felt we could really trust the people we met; they seemed very professional and knowledgeable. We visited some of the houses built by Baufritz, and were very impressed. Finally we decided: this is the only way we should build a house. It simply felt right."
Jayesh Patel

House Bond
"Many times we were told that the house would go up in three or four days and be watertight. To actually see it happen still feels miraculous. When you compare prefabrication to UK conventional builders, who build brick by brick, this is just so much more efficient. To see that speed was just amazing."

House Nicholls
"I always drove German cars, so I attribute quality and durability to German construction companies. I was the first client in the UK market who believed in Baufritz and they confirmed the stereotype of accurate, hardworking and fast Germans."
Andrew Nicholls

House Overton
"Baufritz´s attention to detail is incredible. Your snagging-list is actually very small because things have been done so well first time round. But if there are issues, normally ones that we didn´t even spot, they spotted them, saying that´s not right, we want to make that better. This is second to none."
