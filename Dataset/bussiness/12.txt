Are you fed up with supermarket milk?  Read more about where and how
to buy Real Milk in Britain from pasture fed cows.
Over the last few years milk has become more and more denaturised by the supermarkets
and large dairies and the public have been left in the dark about what has been going on.  The Campaign for Real Milk
is here to expose the true facts to you  -  the consumer  -   and to let you know
where you can buy milk as you used to drink as a child and how you can help to turn back the tide of homogenisation and
long life.
If It Hasn't Got Cream on the Top - Don't Drink It!
