Dendrochronology or tree-ring dating is the scientific method of dating using the annual nature of tree growth in suitable tree species. Dendrochronology allows the exact calendar year in which each tree rings was formed to be established enabling the precise dating of trees and timbers. We undertake both private and commercial commissions in dendrochronology throughout the UK:

Buildings we date by dendrochronology are generally also published in Vernacular Architecture and summaries of the typographic features are available from the Building Archaeological Research Database (BARD).
For further information, please find below a leaflet and two example reports for down load. One on sampling of live trees on the Ancient Oak at Lullingstone Park and one on dating a timber-frame building at The Rock Inn, Chiddingstone.
