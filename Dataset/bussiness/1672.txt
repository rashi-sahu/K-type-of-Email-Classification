Telegraph: Unprecedented in recent times': Rents across the UK set to fall this year

Does not resolve the fundamental issue
Telegraph: 14 New garden towns and villages to provide 200,000 homes to ease housing shortage
With free movement of people, you could build 100 new towns and it would just cause more people to come, particularly with the Eurozone having porous borders to the middle east and Africa, bringing in unvetted people, many of whom are illiterate and incapable of supporting themselves and their families. Of course, few of them will be able to afford any of these new houses. Fine, have lots coming in, but at least work out how many homes we have and can build and be in a position to plan for not only homes but schools, hospitals, jobs, etc!!

Thousands of renters each month are being deemed officially homeless by local councils after being evicted by private landlords and struggling to pay rents that have risen across the country by more 20 per cent since 2010. The figures show a huge rise in people becoming homeless at the end of assured short hold tenancies (ASTs) 'the most common agreement used by private landlords' since 2010

Dollar repatriation
WebCommentary: Steve Bannon plots economic destruction
Interesting view that as soon as the fed tightens i.e. stops the support of the bond market, then nominal rates can be very low because as dollars are repatriated to the US you can get an effective return from the dollar increasing in value.
