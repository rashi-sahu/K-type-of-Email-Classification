Impact Funding
You can now apply for a range of funding to support knowledge exchange and impact activities through
the Essex ESRC Impact Acceleration Account.
We provide advice and support to our University's academic community. We'll help you
find, secure and manage research funding, and commercialise your work. We also co-ordinate
research planning and manage the REF submission.
We support you through the entire research lifecycle. We can help you find
funding and turn a good idea into a research grant application. We also offer guidance
on research ethics and intellectual property
issues, and provide the legal expertise required to negotiate any contract
relating to collaborative research. Once a grant application has been successful, we will administer
your grant on your behalf and provide knowledge exchange support to ensure your research output is
disseminated as widely as possible.
