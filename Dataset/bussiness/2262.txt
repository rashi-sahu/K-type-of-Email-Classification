WHY IS THIS WEBSITE ON-LINE?
Over many years we have become increasingly concerned about the dearth of accurate, unbiased information on all matters relating to energy production, usage and storage.
People are being misled by the media and political statements are being made which in many cases are grossly inaccurate and in some cases completely untrue. This is especially true of wind energy, nuclear power, and 'clean coal'.
Below you will find articles and comments on stories in the press. I add to them as news breaks, so please return to keep up with what is happening. They are arranged by topic and date. Shorter items are on the 'Newsdesk' page.
Links to the left are more general articles about different kinds of fuel.
We hear a lot of comments about global warming. The graphs below show what has happened to global temperatures over recent years.
The view of this website is that energy policy should be rational and evidence-based. We need an energy strategy which minimises waste, delivers energy 24 hours a day at a reasonable price, and enables industry to flourish; we all need jobs.
Everything else should be secondary to that.
