Biomass energy resources
The Biomass Energy Centre resources have a new home Previously hosted on the Biomass Energy Centre (BEC) website, the resources available on these pages offer the most authoritative information on biomass energy.  From advice on equipment to regulatory information, these comprehensive resources have been revamped and are free to our users. N.B. You may have been redirected here when trying to follow a cached or bookmarked link to a page in the old website.  Most of the core contents from the old site should still be available, however the site structure has been reorganized a little so it may be in a different place.  Some information that is time sensitive, or relates to bioenergy topics not relevant to forestry (such as AD, for which go to the Official AD Portal) has not been retained.
General biomass information
General background information about what biomass is and why you might want to use it.
Fuel
Information about types of woodfuel, where it comes from and how it can be produced.  There is information about forestry as a source of woodfuel and also energy crops.
Equipment
Information about the different types of equipment available to make use of the various forms of woodfuel, some of their characteristics, advantages and disadvantages.
Technical and regulatory
International standards and specifications for solid biofuels and equipment help ensure efficient, safe, trouble free operation, regulations to ensure equipments is installed safely and pollution is avoided.  Also information on sustainability and emissions.
Reference
This section contains the facts and figures pages, the publications and downloads, links and the glossary.
BEC woodfuel suppliers database (NBSD)
This (external link) leads to Google Map based database of suppliers of different forms of woodfuel within the UK.  Suppliers can be filtered on the basis of fuel type (e.g. firewood logs, woodchips, pellets, etc.), and also by accreditation (such as Woodsure).  However this is simply an online database as a service both to UK woodfuel users and suppliers and there is no assessment or endorsement by Forest Research or the Biomass Energy Centre. If you are a UK woodfuel retail supplier the database if free to sign up for and there is a button on the NBSD website to allow you to enter your details
