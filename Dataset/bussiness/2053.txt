What happens after you are repossessed?8th January 2016Delaying Repossession while you sell your home3rd January 2016Contacted Adam on the Sunday before Easter , and after what was a tricky and pretty complicated situation Adam was able to get my property sold stopping my double eviction in its tracks. Leaving us with a tidy sum in our pockets… The patience of a god with all our questions enquiries and worries, reassured us all the way through , we are smiling in a way we haven’t done for a while.

"Moving is extremely stressful at the best of times, but we were lucky to have Adam and his team on hand to help sell the house for us. He totally understood our situation and kept in constant contact to keep us informed of any progress made with transactions. He came over as very kind, sympathetic, understanding and nothing seemed too much trouble. We have now found a wonderful property and are gradually settling in, which could not have happened without Adam. Many, many thanks Adam! Personally, I would give you 10 stars!\r\nBest wishes\r\nMaggie Copperwheat"
