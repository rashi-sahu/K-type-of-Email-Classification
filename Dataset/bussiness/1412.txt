It may also be of note that on Sunday 6th Sept 2015, a Michael Bludworth of Texas, USA made the comment on Civil Model Aircraft's Facebook site
" Ouch, I see they used minicraft DC-3 for the aircraft outline". The webmaster for my site responded with the following comment on the site with is authorised by myself.
" It might interest you but Welsh Models bought out their first DC-3 kit long before many other manufacturers. Each pattern is hand built from original drawings only, as has always been the case since inception. Welshmodels still has each and every original reference data/Plan/pattern/mould of every kit manufactured through their lifetime. Heat Shrinkage, calculated so the models are exact scale when produced is all worked into the original mould dimensions, unlike others over time who have 'quite obviously' copied moulds and then the shrinkage afterwards is greater rendering them smaller in exact scale. Welshmodels have never copied any other manufacturers scale models or drawings. The drawings in this case were copied from the original scale plans provided recently from the USA which has allowed three differing types of model of the DC-3 to be manufactured, and the scale rendering for the image above was then transferred through 'Cranc' decals. Welsh Models pride themselves in always producing 'Original' kits from start to finish and take offence to those who may imply that any part of their kits was copied from another manufacturer. Fact - Welshmodels DC-3 was first produced 18 years ago. Fact - Minicrafts DC-3 was first produced 11 years ago. These facts were further clariifed today by an eminent modelling writer of note who made both respective manufacturers kits on release. "
To say this persons comments are uncalled for are an understatement to all the effort put into Welshmodels over the many years Trisha and I have built it to what it is today.
