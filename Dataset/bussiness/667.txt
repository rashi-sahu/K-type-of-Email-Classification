Open First
At Collabora we believe that Open Source is much more than a development model. Free and open access to software is the only way to cope with today's rate of innovation. None of the major technology innovations and infrastructure evolutions of the past 10 years would have been possible without Open Source.
About Collabora
Whether writing a line of code or shaping a longer-term strategic software development plan, we'll help
you navigate the ever-evolving world of Open Source.
