Whether it be sea trout fishing in Wales on the River Teifi or Towy or fishing for bass from boat or shore along Wales’ extensive coastline – Angling-Worldwide offers you this and a whole lot more.
We have something to offer across most areas in Wales, be you in search of salmon, bass, sea trout, trout or grayling. If you don’t see it listed then please contact us, chances are we will be able to assist. Looking for something further afield? We have teamed up with Aardvark McLeod to offer all destination travel aspects, so please do make contact if you’re looking to undertake that journey of a lifetime, some of which are often hosted by us.
Angling-Worldwide offers a unique and unrivalled service to its clients and friends. We’re a small company offering a fully tailored and personable experience to the venturing angler. You’ll be dealt with as if you were a friend, not just another number on the sales sheet. But don’t take our word for it, please check through our unbiased testimonials from past clients, many of whom are now regulars.
This quality of service doesn’t need to come at a price. We’ll formulate your ideal package whilst still keeping costs as low as possible – indeed, if you’ve seen prices lower elsewhere for identical packages then give us a chance to beat or match them.
Second best or ‘good enough’ is not our end goal or working ethos. We want your experience to be pleasurable from start to finish, that’s why we will offer more choices and more information through the booking process than anyone else in the business, guaranteed. It’s that level of customer service that makes our clients our friends and our competitors’ second best.
