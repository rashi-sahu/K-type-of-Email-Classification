Welcome to the Fowler de Pledge home page.
Fowler de Pledge (FdP) was established in 1991 by Paul de Pledge and Andrew Fowler. In September 2009 FdP underwent dynamic changes, becoming one of the first LDPs (Legal Disciplinary Practice) in the region. This structure allows multiple disciplines to be provided under one roof, so FdP extended its well-established legal commercial base to include both corporate finance and forensic accounting.
FdP has taken this one step further in 2016, becoming one of the first legal firms in Cambridgeshire to become an ABSs (Alternative Business Structure). This gives FdP ultimate flexibility in terms of future business opportunities, whilst remaining firmly under the auspices of the Solicitors Regulation Authority for compliance.
The firm has two offices (Cambridge and Farnham), and six partners
(Paul de Pledge,
Alan Mason, Andrew Brewer, Peter Martin, Angela Adam and Deryn Coe), together with consultant solicitor, Andrew Fowler, all ably assisted by Associate Legal Executive Karen Greaves and PAs Gina Ball and Gemma Mace.
