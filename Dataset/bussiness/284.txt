Welcome
Pensions
are a major public policy issue in most OECD countries and it is not difficult
to understand why. In most countries, pensions represent a large fraction
of government fiscal obligations, a burden which is forecasted to increase
yet further as the "baby boom" generation approaches retirement. At the same
time, private pensions are a major component of financial markets (for example,
in the UK the value of pension funds is approximately equal to 100% of UK GDP) and an important contributor to savings, investment and economic growth.
The Pensions Institute
(PI) is the first and only U.K. academic research centre focused entirely
on pensions research. The purpose of this centre is to serve as a clearinghouse
for information on pensions, with particular emphasis on the U.K. system,
and to publicize PI research and activities.
