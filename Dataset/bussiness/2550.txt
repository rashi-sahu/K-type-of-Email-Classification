Yes, your service is very useful. We have recommended you a number of times to date, as a resource for people, mainly friends, looking for property to move into or just move house within in our area.
Roger, 16th February 2017
Thanks for this. Yes, the service is very useful for me. I am not sure if other websites offer the same detail for multiple postcodes, but I have not needed to look as yours offers what I need.
