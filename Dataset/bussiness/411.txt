As co-founder of SwiftKey, I've worked with Ability Resourcing for the last three years to build up a team of talented technical staff to support a high growth strategy. They have been reliable throughout and have demonstrated exceptional insight into our business and a remarkable ability to locate high quality candidates and shepherd them through the recruitment process. Within a short space of time we've been able to put together one of the most talented technical teams in the UK and that is in no small part thanks to them!

Mike has been my "go to guy" on recruitment for a long time for a simple reason - he delivers what he says, when he says it. I can't offer a better recommendation for Mike and his company than this. Mike has demonstrated an exceptional level of integrity and expertise in everything he has done for me. He has helped me secure some of the top talent to build our business and has made it fun on the way.
