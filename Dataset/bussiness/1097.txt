PRINT: THE NEW DIGITAL FRONTLINE
OUR PARENTS TAUGHT US TO LOOK WITH OUR EYES NOT OUR HANDS
WHAT IF WE COULD LOOK WITH OUR HANDS?
TOUCH CAN HELP US SEE BENEATH THE SURFACE
NOVALIA UNLOCKS YOUR CHILDHOOD DESIRE TO DISCOVER THROUGH TOUCH
Novalia’s technology adds touch, connectivity and data to surfaces around us.
We play in the space between the physical and digital using beautiful, tactile printed touch sensors to connect people, places and objects.
Touching our print either triggers sounds from its surface or sends information to the internet.
From postcard to bus shelter size, our interactive print is often as thin as a piece of paper.
Let’s blend science with design to create experiences indistinguishable from magic.
