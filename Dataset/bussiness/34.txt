Guidance from the Scientific Advisory Committee on Genetic Modification
Please note that with effect from 1 October 2014, parts 1 and 3 of the guidance will not reflect the current Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) Regulations 2014.
Specific references to the legislation, operation of the safety committee
and containment requirements in these parts need to be updated. Although legally correct, the opportunity will also be taken to amend the other parts of the guidance (parts 2, 4, 5 and 6) to take account of current working practices and technological advances.
This is guidance prepared, in consultation with HSE, by the SAGCM which
was appointed by the Health and Safety Commission as part of its formal
advisory structure. The guidance represents what is considered to be good
practice by the members of the Committee. It has been agreed by the Commission.
Following this guidance is not compulsory and you are free to take other
action. But if you do follow this guidance you will normally be doing enough
to comply with the law. Health and safety inspectors seek to secure compliance
with the law and may refer to this guidance as illustrating good practice.
This document is available as a series of PDF files (viewable with Acrobat Reader) linked below.
Part 1: Introduction to the legislation and general health and safety issues
Part 2: Risk assessment of genetically modified
microorganisms (other than those associated with plants) [2.1MB]
Part 3: Containment and control of activities involving genetically modified microorganisms
Part 4: Genetic modification work that involves plants (including plant-associated genetically modified microorganisms)
Part 5: Genetic modification of animals
Part 6: Guidance on the use of genetically modified microorganisms in a clinical setting
