Trees & Woodland
in Wales
Our vision...
Welcome
We are Wales’ foremost woodland organisation.  Our aims are to improve the condition of Welsh woodland and integrate new woodlands within the landscape. Our staff provide advice and support, innovation and access to grant aid.  We bring research into practice about the role of trees in flooding, soils and water, agricultural productivity and wider ecosystem services.  Our established body of work in timber development enables cooperative projects between woodland and timber businesses, to increase the economic value from timber and enhance the performance and quality of Welsh timber products.
