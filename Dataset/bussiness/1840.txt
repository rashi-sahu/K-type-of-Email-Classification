It's a combination of Stay and Vacation and it has been used a lot in the media in the UK over the past summers to describe the trend of British residents to stay closer to home, rather than holiday abroad. Students are introduced to the idea of ‘Staycations’,
there is a speaking task where they discuss the benefits of this type of holiday and a mingling activity where they can find out about their classmates’ experiences.
Students will also practise reading, writing and giving opinons in this integrated lesson plan, as well as designing their ideal staycation.Topic: Holidays and staycations.Aims: •	To review vocabulary related to holidays•	To practise speaking skills in a discussion•	To practise question formation•	To develop reading skills•	To practise writing skillsAge group: 12 - adultLevel:
