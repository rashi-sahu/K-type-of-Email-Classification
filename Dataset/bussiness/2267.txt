The author is an independent engineer who is familiar
with most heat pumps, with allegiance to none.The book
is mostly aimed at the consumer, and lays out the options
and issues starting from the basic first principles.
It has a refreshingly straightforward approach, with
enough technical detail to satisfy architects and installers
too. It is completely jargon and hype-free, and tackles
all types of system. It discusses different building
types and their suitability for this technology in an
un-biased and neutral way.
Discusses wider environmental issues too.

What
is a Heat Pump?
More and more homes in the UK are being heated
by heat pumps. This little understood concept
has been around for many years, but has only
recently become of interest due to the current
concerns over global warming and environmental
issues
This technology is not appropriate for every
situation, and there are pitfalls to avoid.
It is mostly viable in remote areas where mains
gas is not available. It is particularly suited
to well insulated houses with underfloor heating,
or background heating for older houses.
