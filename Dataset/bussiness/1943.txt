Our Priorities
Supporting businesses
Businesses and social enterprises in the Highlands and Islands are ambitious, both for their individual enterprise and for the growth of the region as a whole. Greater economic prosperity will be delivered through private sector led investments which create jobs and wealth.
More about Supporting businesses
Developing growth sectors
The Government Economic Strategy (GES) identifies seven sectors as offering particular opportunities for growth due to existing comparative advantages or through potential to capitalise on Scotland's unique natural assets.
More about Developing growth sectors
Creating a competitive region
HIE plays a leading role in developing the conditions which will enable the Highlands and Islands to fulfil its potential as a globally competitive region with a thriving, low carbon economy.
More about Creating a competitive region
Strengthening communities
Strong communities are essential to the continued success of the Highlands and Islands. Social and economic developments are complementary in achieving growth, particularly in remote, sparsely-populated areas.
