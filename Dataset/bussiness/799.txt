Felinfoel Brewery, the Home of The Dragon.
As the name implies, Felinfoel brewery is situated in 'Felinfoel', a small village adjoining Llanelli in Wales. Historians tell us that in the old days the inn brewed its own beer, but only during the winter months. The keeping qualities and the strength of the beers, therefore, were of prime importance and the popularity of 'Felinfoel Beer' led to the local inn brewing for other inns in the locality. This, in turn, led to the present brewery being built in 1878 to accomodate demand.
