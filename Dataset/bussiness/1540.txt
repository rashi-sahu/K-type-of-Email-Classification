We are BAT – our company video
The people who help make us the company we are today take centre stage in our company video, We are BAT.
The video presents our business through the eyes of our employees and those we work with around the world. Among those we hear from are a farmer whose family has been supplying us with tobacco for three generations and BAT scientists involved in developing a next generation of potentially less harmful nicotine products.
We believe their stories show who we are: a progressive company that’s proud of its heritage and excited about the future.
