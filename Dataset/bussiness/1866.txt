About Voyager Alliance Credit Union
Voyager Alliance Credit Union is a financial cooperative owned and run by its members.
In reality this means that as we have no shareholders all of our profit remains within the organisation.
The credit union was formed by local authority employees but over the years as councils sold off parts of its operation this has resulted in us now having a diverse range of members from across the UK.
