Our Philosophy
Enable
Flynet Viewer TE (Terminal Emulation) provides an instant web browser based terminal emulator to key business systems, including Mainframe, iSeries, Unix, VMS or multivalue system, on any device with zero client software installation, all centrally managed via the Flynet Viewer administration centre.
Flynet Viewer supports client and server side macro creation and keyboard remapping out of the box.
Enhance
Flynet Viewer Studio UX (User Experience) is a No Code and Low Code Platform that allows you to reshape how you interact with your Mainframe, iSeries, Unix, VMS or multivalue system, changing green screen user experiences into contemporary interfaces that are delivered over the web. This gives you the freedom to adapt and evolve business processes, quickly realising new efficiencies and gaining instant ROI and tactical advantages that are simply not available elsewhere, what’s more, this can be done by a super user or Citizen Developer.
Evolve
The Flynet Viewer Studio WS (Web Services) is a WYSIWYG W3C WebService generator for Mainframe, iSeries, Unix, VMS and Multivalue systems.
It transforms your host environment into a dynamic component of your business systems interface layer, normally confined to the transaction layer of the enterprise, these new tools will unleash your investment in your host system to freely interact with and feed tertiary business systems, increasing the availability, timeliness and integrity of key business data.
