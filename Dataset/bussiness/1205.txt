02ClientsHow we've helped“I really appreciate all you have done to help with the recruitment process so far. I find it fascinating just how accurate the assessment and profiles of the shortlisted candidates were. I will, of course, be in touch as soon as we have our next LAB profiling to do as it forms a very important part of the overall interview process.” Lynn Woodcock, Director of OperationsByRWS Ltd“Katherine's expertise in analysing job descriptions to establish the motivations this person would need in this role, gave me enormous confidence that our recruitment process would result in us being able to attract and select the right person.  My deputy has been at CCAB for several months now and is exactly what we had hoped for. I would recommend talking to Katherine at Recrion before embarking on a key recruitment campaign.” Rachel Talbot, CEOByCambridgeshire Citizens advice Bureau“I was extremely impressed with Recrion’s design and management of the whole recruitment selection process during our restructure.
