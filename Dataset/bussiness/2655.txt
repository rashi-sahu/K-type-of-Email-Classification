ABOUT US
We are Integrated Ideas. Simply put, we are a design and development agency based in the heart of Woodbridge, Suffolk - just outside Ipswich.We're highly praised for our digital work - design and technical. It's not just a case of making good looking websites... although we do love making good looking websites. In terms of design and branding, we're always keen to hear your ideas. It doesn't matter if it's a favourite colour scheme, or an image you're mad about.But with every great website, there should be a great marketing campaign. Our team is well-versed in Google Analytics and email marketing systems (EMS), so we can target potential clients and monitor responses. We also have our own proprietary content management systems (CMS), so that you can keep your website up-to-date.To say we can only offer you a well-managed, well-marketed website would be a lie. Idea integration isn't limited to the online world. Our design and management work extends to print and offline communication, whether it's a leaflet or a public exhibition. It's about tailoring a communication strategy to suit your needs.After all, we don't want to work for you; we want to work with you.

TESTIMONIALS
“We are extremely pleased with our new website and with this being our first we were looking for a company to take the lead and drive the development of the website forward. Integrated Ideas provided exactly what was needed and with their technical knowledge and experience produced what we believe is a large step forward for our business. Having had no experience of updating a website we have found the management system to be quick, logical and user friendly.We would have no hesitation in recommending Integrated Ideas to anyone who required the services of a friendly, professional company for their IT solutions.”Stuart Boardley, Director
“Effective communication of our product in written and audio-visual formats into the Russian consumer and investor markets which had never experienced its like before was a commercial imperative on this project. Integrated Ideas were able to devise and produce a multi-media communications programme which achieved this in a compelling way and under great pressure of expectation and time. It was a significant challenge which was well met and made enjoyable by the intellectual and creative capabilities applied to it by Integrated Ideas. Working with Integrated Ideas was a rewarding professional experience which I would recommend to anyone with a message that needs to be conveyed.”David Margason, Managing Director
“Integrated ideas designed, printed and delivered an attractive and very well received conference program booklet for us. Their attention to detail: from sourcing the right cover image; to the application of our branded fonts and styles; and patiently incorporating our change requests at the 11th hour, made them the ideal partner for us. I could not
recommend them highly enough, I look forward to working with them again.”Shiva Kant, Project Manager
“You guys are awesome and I will happily promote your service to all my senior IHG sales & marketing colleagues!
And of course the GM’S.”Cathy Mead, Sales and Marketing Director

DON’T FORGET THE PRINTI love printed design – you simply can’t beat the smell of a freshly printed brochure and the feel of the stock on your fingertips! It’s fantastic! In recent years there has been a dramatic move to digital marketing as companies fight to increase their presence online, as such budgets for printed materials have been in […]> Read more
FLAT DESIGNA logo often forms your first impression of a brand. It’s your first point of contact; your immediate basis to form an opinion. Logos will tell a lot about who you are and what message you’re trying to convey. But how much thought actually goes into a logo? The logo will give you an opinion, but […]> Read more
DESIGN TRENDS 2014As the New Year begins to pick up steam, it may be a good time to think about your website and brand. Design trends are constantly evolving, and we, as consumers, are being encouraged to keep up with this change or be left behind. Taking this into consideration, is it worth thinking about updating your […]> Read more
RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGNWe’ve all had the same frustrating problem: you visit a website on your smartphone or tablet and the formatting is so distorted that you look elsewhere. There’s nothing more off putting for any mobile user, as you can’t keep track of what you’re doing (especially a nuisance for those online shoppers!) Responsive website design fixes […]> Read more
