Inca Digital Printers is an industry leader in the design, development and manufacture of inkjet printers for the print industry.
To date, this work has focused on equipment for the POS sector, but the technology is also suitable for other industrial applications and is an important area for future growth.
Inca Digital was the first company to design and manufacture a moving table flatbed printer for the printing industry in 2001 with the Eagle 44. Since then, the company has proved itself as an innovator and leader in the field of inkjet producing another eleven machine model designs to date, resulting in industry acclaim.
In 2007, the launch of the Inca Onset created a paradigm shift in digital print quality delivering a digital press that for the first time could really take screen printing volume and that would become a real workhorse for its owners.
Since the launch of the Onset, Inca has expanded its range with the Onset S20i, Onset S40i, Onset Q40i, Onset S50i, Onset R40i and Onset R50i. With this ongoing product development Inca continuously seeks new solutions to the challenges their customers encounter.
