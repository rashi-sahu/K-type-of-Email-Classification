University of Glasgow Data Registry Update
August 15, 2013
Valerie Leave a comment
I’m very enthusiastic that our live data registry has live metadata in it.  It also has a CERIF export option .
Most of the metadata records include links to data held in third party repositories.
Real Datasets
We’ve lots on our to do list but making progress with our new (more responsive, more robust, and dedicated) server being set up,  DataCite almost ready to go (pending new server), and considerations over standardising fields being discussed with other ePrints sites based around the ReCollect plug-in for Datasets produced by the University of Essex.

Discussing issues Glasgow
Many thanks to everyone who attended the workshops in Glasgow and London and contributed to the lively exchange. It was great to see so many colleagues travelling from near and far to take part and share their experiences.
A summary of the feedback from those who returned a form can be viewed here:
Attendees Feedback
Overall feedback was very positive.  In fact I noticed that the most negative comments came from the project team members ourselves!
An informal ammalgamated summary of the discussion notes is available now:
Issues Discussed at CERIF 4 Datasets Workshops July 2013
The key issues raised included:
1) Clarifying the specification for research data management
2) Getting Senior Management committment
3) Setting up suitable systems and processes
4) Getting staff to engage with Research Data Management
5) Quantifying costs and getting budget
6) Integration of services across organisational boundaries
As well as including key points in our final report to Jisc we will be following up on some of these issues e.g. for item 1 we will speak to ARMA about co-ordinating work on clarifying data management requirements. More blog posts may result and there may be email requests and updates to workshop attendees.

Any other ideas or comments not covered at the workshop are most welcome and will be considered for the project manager’s final report which I plan to post on this blog by the end of September.
Anna and I are both away on holiday next week but I will follow up on any comments or feedback on my return week commencing 12th August.
Once again, thanks to everyone who helped to make the workshops a success.

Datasets, Publications, and ORCID
July 31, 2013

Hi All,
Here is a link to a paper we recently published.
http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/83882/ (DOI http://dx.doi.org/10.1629/2048-7754.80)
It is primarily about open access to publications but as funders often require some reference to datasets it does include some comment on what we are doing to integrate information about datasets into the overall open access process.
In addition a few folk were interested in ORCID.
Here is a screen shot of the article attached to my ORCID id.
ORCID SCREEN SHOT
University of Glasgow have subscribed to ORCID and we are currently in the early stages of working out how we will synchronise information about research outputs etc and hope to be able to share our journey with the community.
