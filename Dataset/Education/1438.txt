Without a Paddle
Without a Paddle is part of the SWaNI FE Learning and Teaching Innovation Grants programme funded by Joint Informations Systems Committee (JISC).
The project aims to test the transferability of the Minimally invasive education environment trialled by Sugata Mitra in India, to other contexts. The project will use mobile devices to investigate how extant apps, designed for a multitude of purposes can be repurposed to support different learning outcomes. The project will present a configuration of apps to learners via a smart phone with a little or no explanatory context and hopes to stimulate the learner to develop initiative, problem solving and research skills.
