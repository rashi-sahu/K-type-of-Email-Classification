Staffordshire Past TrackSunday, February 19th, 2017 at 5:23pmCoal picking at Apedale, Newcastle-under-Lyme, 1912. The Miners' strike in 1912 was one of the first nationwide strikes that was led by the newly formed Miners Union, who were demanding a national minimum wage. Many miners received no Union pay during the dispute. By March there was a coal shortage and the coal that was available became more expensive. This scene shows people searching for any pieces of coal that they could take and use at home. Note the empty coal wagons in the background, stationary on the track. From the collections of Brampton Museum
