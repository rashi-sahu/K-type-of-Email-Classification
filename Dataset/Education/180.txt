The collection of artwork dates back to 1904 and includes work by W.K. Haselden, Will Dyson, Sidney Strube, David Low, Vicky, Emmwood, Michael Cummings, Ralph Steadman, Mel Calman, Nicholas Garland, Chris Riddell, Carl Giles, Martin Rowson, and Steve Bell, amongst many others.

This book draws on Carl Giles' vast private archive, held by the BCA. It was published in 2008 to coincide with the Giles exhibitions in London and Ipswich, and reflects every aspect of his professional life, from producing the cartoons and running his studio, to dealing with editors and replying to fans. Giles - One of the Family £25
