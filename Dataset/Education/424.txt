Research
Now that digital connections are embedded in almost every aspect of everyday life, research on individual, collective and institutional behaviour on the Internet is crucial to understand the social, economic and political world. Our multidisciplinary faculty and graduate students use a diverse methodological toolkit to understand digital life.
Research themes
Our research is organised in eight broad themes, where the Internet is having a significant effect on social, economic and political activity worldwide.
Digital Economies
We are applying economics to issues of broad social import—from media bias to cybersecurity—to understand the role of incentives and individual behaviour in these arenas.
Digital Knowledge and Culture
New technologies have enabled innovations in the ways in which we create knowledge, access information, and engage with our heritage.
Digital Politics and Government
The Internet has transformed political behaviour, from voting and campaigning for policy change, to protest and even revolution.
Education, Digital Life and Wellbeing
The Internet plays an important part in our daily lives, and our research addresses the psychological, social and educational implications of the Internet.
Ethics and Philosophy of Information
We are investigating the conceptual aspects of the radical transformations of reality brought about by the information revolution.
Information Geography and Inequality
Through surveys, interviews and mapping of virtual labour and knowledge economies, we’re examining the differences being made by ICTs at the world’s economic peripheries.
Information Governance and Security
The big data generated by digital interactions between people, organisations, and artefacts poses numerous challenges to information governance and regulation.
Social Data Science
Social data science can generate theory-informed predictive models and underpin the way we understand and solve social problems.
Our research is organised in eight broad themes, where the Internet is having a significant effect on social, economic and political activity worldwide.
