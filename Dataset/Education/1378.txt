Why have a special page for women graduates?
It is now almost 40 years since the Sex
Discrimination Act became law, yet there are still many areas in which women
graduates have yet to achieve full equality. For example:
On average, male graduates earn 10%
more than females six months after
graduation (HESA)
This pay gap continues to the highest levels: female directors earn an average basic salary of £127,257, compared to
£141,946 for the average male director (Chartered Management Institute )
One in five FTSE 100
companies have no women on the board of directors www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7c1ddf48-c20c-11e1-8e7c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2MIk8OEmr
Only 27% of police
officers (and 13.7% of chief constables) are
women (Counting Women and www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/sn00634.pdf)
While a third of
practising barristers and almost half of practising solicitors are women, less
than a quarter of the judiciary are female (Ministry of Justice). Armenia, (just under 23%) and Azerbaijan
(9%) are the only European countries with fewer women judges (Council of
Europe).
In most chartered accountancy firms, fewer than
15% of the partners are female. Only three of the Top 50 firms have more than
25% female partners. and no firms have an equal proportion (Accountancy
Age, 2012).
In Government, men make up 77% of MPs,
two-thirds of MEPs, 83% of Permanent Secretaries (the most senior civil
servants) and 77% of local government chief executives (Counting Women)
A
study has found that women are less likely to apply for vacancies that use "male" sounding words. If the vacancies used words commonly associated with men, like “assertive”, “independent”, “aggressive”, “analytical” and "determined", the women said they found the job less appealing, and were less likely to apply. However, if the advert used words such as “dedicated”, “responsible”, “conscientious” and “sociable” they were more likely to think the job was for them.
At local level, 32% of councillors, 12%
of council leaders and 13% of elected mayors are female (Counting Women)
In universities, only 17 out of the UK’s 115 universities have a female Vice-Chancellor (Kent
is, of course, one of these www.kent.ac.uk/about/vicechancellor) and only 20% of professors are female (Universities UK and HESA, 2012)
Even in careers where women make up the
majority of the workforce, they tend to be under-represented at senior levels.
For example, 73% of teachers are female but only a third of school heads (Department for Education)
Less than half of UK
employers provide childcare support to help parents combine work with family commitments (Hay Group, 2012)
A report for Opportunity Now, the
business-led campaign for women's advancement, identified family
responsibilities, perceptions of women as less committed and stereotyping about
female roles and abilities as the biggest factors holding women back http://wimuk.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Barriers_to_Work1.pdf
LinkedIn Article Four Ways Women Stunt Their Careers Unintentionally
Becoming a mother 'makes women better at their jobs'
Generation Y women have best skills to break glass ceiling
Female bankers perform better than males - they take less risks and break the rules less than males
But there is some good news …
A study by
Leeds University Business School of 17,000 companies in 2008 found that having at least one female director on the board cut a company's chances of going bust by 20% and that having two or three female directors lowered the chances of bankruptcy even further!
Female graduates have lower unemployment rates than male graduates (HECSU)
The salary differential between graduates and non-graduates
is greater for women than for men,
suggesting that the possession of a degree is probably even more financially
worthwhile for women.
The percentage of women in key roles is slowly increasing: five years ago fewer than 10% of FTSE 100 companies
had a woman on the board and 90% of judges were male.
Women heading corporate departments earn more than
their male counterparts
(Statistics and examples from
Prospects, the Equality & Human Rights Commission, Target Jobs, the Department
for Business, Innovation & Skills and the Chartered Management Institute)
However, although inequality for women
remains a reality, increasing numbers of women are overcoming these barriers,
smashing through the “glass ceiling” and achieving their ambitions in all kinds
of organisations.
Women are often chosen as leaders in times of crisis
Women are often appointed leaders of successful companies in their critical moments. For example: the appointments of the prime minister of Sweden when the country suffered as a result of the global recession and
the CEO of the
Sunoco oil company, appointed when its share price dropped by half. But why does this phenomenon (called "The glass cliff"), occur?
A
study conducted by Caliper2 and Aurora in 2005 found a number of characteristics that distinguish women leaders from men:
Women leaders are more persuasive than male leaders.
When rejected, women leaders learn from adversity and carry on with an "I’ll show you” attitude.
Women leaders have an inclusive, team-building leadership style of problem solving and decision making.
Women leaders are more likely to ignore rules and take risks.
Despite these findings Susanna Bruckmüller and Nyla Branscombe (2010) noted that women often only became leaders in times of trouble because men lack the qualities to do so.

Acting on an anonymous phone call, the police raid a house to arrest a
suspected murderer.
They don't know what he looks like, but they know
his name is John. Inside they find a carpenter, a lorry driver, a car
mechanic, and a fireman playing cards.
Without even asking his name they
immediately arrest the fireman. How do they know they have got their
man?

Rehtom Inc posted a job advert for the world’s toughest job: a Director of Operations; working 135 hours per week without breaks, working extra hours on holidays, sacrificing
social life,
no time off and no pay.
Despite 2.7 million impressions, the
advert only received 24 applicants who were interviewed via webcam.
At the end of the interview they were
surprised to be told that the job they were applying for was that of a typical mother!

There are many other women graduates
from the University who have made a success of their life and career – some in
the public eye, some within less high-profile roles and organisations and some
simply on their own terms, like the teacher who summed up herself as “never
going to be rich or important, but perfectly content”.

Finding positive employers
These may be employers who have strong
equal opportunities policies; employers where a significant number of women
have achieved senior positions or employers who have taken initiatives to offer
flexible or family-friendly working.
TOP 50 Employers for women 2014
http://opportunitynow.bitc.org.uk/Awards/TTT502014
“Britain's
Top Employers” www.britainstopemployers.co.uk/BritainsTopEmployers.aspx rates around 80 companies on factors including
diversity initiatives, flexible working and career development;
A long time ago a government official asked my mother, "What is your occupation?"
My mother who was seeking renewal of her license seemed to
be puzzled so the officer clarified, “Are you employed, do you have your own
business or what?”
My mother replied, "Oh, I understand, I have a full
time occupation as a mother."
Official: "I’m afraid we don't have 'mother' listed as
an option for occupation-  I will write
it down as 'housewife'"
Years later when I went to get my license, the official
was a somewhat pompous woman. "Your occupation?" she asked in an
authoritative tone.
I had an inspiration and replied: "I’m a
researcher in the field of child development, nutrition and inter-personal
relationships."
The official stared at me in amazement.
I calmly repeated my statement and she wrote it down
verbatim. Then, unable to conceal her curiosity, she politely asked, "What exactly do you do in your profession, madam?"
I was feeling good about having described my occupation so
calmly and confidently so I replied, "My research projects have been going on for a number
of years (mothers never retire!). My research is conducted in the laboratory
as well as in the field. I have received two awards in this field (my son and
daughter) and my topic is considered to be one of the most difficult parts
of sociology (all mums will agree). I work more than 14 hours every day sometimes
even 24 hours are not enough and the challenges are tougher than many other
professions. My compensation is in terms of mental satisfaction rather than
money."
I could see that the officer was
impressed. After
completing the licencing formalities, she came to the door to see me off and this
new viewpoint about my occupation made me feel much better on my way back home.
I was welcomed by my 5 year old research assistant at the
door and my new project (my 10 month old baby) was energetically practicing her
'music'. I had earned a small victory over the governmental red tape
today. I was no longer 'merely a mother', instead I was now a highly placed functionary in a service vital For mankind: motherhood!
