Results and dissemination
Writeslike.us: a Rapid Innovation project
Writeslike.us was a 6-month JISC-funded project that explored the automated extraction of information about community structures. It was led by UKOLN at the University of Bath, with the University of Minho as a partner. The project ran from April to October 2009.
This is a practical development project for development of a prototype repository enhancement service which automatically extracts candidate community participation information from analysis of existing documents and metadata. Along with the prototype a sample interface will be developed and tested. This project links formal and informal metadata for the purpose of helping individuals discover others with shared topics and interests, which has been described as an important step in linking individuals together without formal social networking information.
