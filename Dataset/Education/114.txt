ePPSME blogePPSME project blog14 December 2010STEEL the Showcase event: ePPSME presented
Earlier in the year we submitted the ePPSME project as a case study to a Higher Education Academy funded project led by Leeds Metropolitan University. HEA project page is at: http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/projects/detail/learningandtechnology/seminar_series/STEEL and the project details/blog etc are at: http://steelproject.wordpress.com/The case study has been included in a booklet: Technology Enhanced Employabilty and Employee Learning: a staff guide. Copies of the guide can be obtained from the STEEL project team at Leeds Met. A pdf version is available from: http://www.leedsmet.ac.uk/alt/index_publications.htmWe were also asked to present our ePPSME project at a dissemination event in Leeds on Thursday 9th December 2010. Despite the arctic weather conditions we got there in one piece and gave a brief overview of the work we've done and then answered questions in two round table discussions. A copy of our presentation can be viewed from the file here.Leeds Met are setting up a wiki to continue to collect and collate evidence of practice. We'll add a link to the wiki when its available.

Work to develop the Learner support web-folio is almost complete. This will be available as a web-site, via a public URL, and is intended to help learners who are thinking about enrolling for one of our ePPSME units, or who are studying on one.We're just putting the finishing touches to the web-folio before we make it live but will post the URL in this blog as soon as it's available.0 CommentsPosted by Alison Felce at 15:18View this 'Thought'23rd - 26th November 2010 - JISC e-learning conference - Have-a-go sessions
We put forward our narrated demonstration web-folio for the Have-a-Go sessions as part of the JISC e-learning conference.

The interim progress report was submitted to JISC for the end of September deadline. The summary given in the report states:The primary work on the project is complete; it is on budget and has met all key programme dates. The third of the three retreats was held in June 2010 and the processes and guidelines have been finalised. Three pilot units have been completed and the learning from each unit has informed the research for and development of the subsequent pilot units. A fourth pilot is due to complete in early December 2010, feedback and evaluation from this will be included in the final report. Evaluation interviews with those involved in the project, employers, learners and University staff have been completed during August and September. Findings from the project have been disseminated at a number of conferences and JISC events and two papers have been submitted to peer reviewed publications.The project team and seven partners submitted a successful bid for a Benefits Realisation Project to develop an e-portfolio pedagogies community of practice (ePCoP) which will run until end March 2011. 0 CommentsPosted by Alison Felce at 15:09View this 'Thought'04 December 201020th Oct 2010 - Festival of Assemblies - Oxford
Emma and Alison led a workshop on the ePCoP project and shared Mary's learning journey - a Muvizu presentation based on the presentation at the UALL conference in July. The file is currently being revised but a link to it will be posted on the blog when it is available.There was a "trade fair" at the event and the draft narrated demo web folio for the ePPSME model was presented. It was quite noisy at the event so people couldn't hear the narration, even with the earphones we supplied - something to think about for future events.The video can be viewed at: http://tinyurl.com/eppsme-have-a-go If you have any feedback we'd love to hear it. You can send it to: a.e.felce@wlv.ac.ukGeneral information from the event can be seen on the JISC/SSBR website at: http://assemblies.inin.jisc-ssbr.net/phase-3-lll-wfd-assemblies/0 CommentsPosted by Alison Felce at 17:54View this 'Thought'7th Oct 2010 - ePCoP Project Meeting 2

2010 - ePPSME model used in Foundation Degree
The project team has worked with a colleague in the School of Technology at the University to develop the ePPSME 5-credit units as part of a Foundation Degree for work-based learners. The course has also been accredited by a professional body.Learners study four 5-credit units consecutively to achieve a 20 credit module. They then register for the foundation degree and study the remaining modules on a block release basis where the e-portfolio is used to support learners, for group and individual activities, for contact with tutors and for personal reflections between their face-to-face sessions.The aim is for the ePPSME units to act as introductory units to HE to encourage practice-based learners to continue to complete the full course.Initial feedback is very positive and learners are submitting some very high quality work.0 CommentsPosted by Alison Felce at 17:40View this 'Thought'7-9th Sept 2010
- Alt-C Presentation
Emma and Rachel gave a presentation on the project at the Alt-C conference in September.The project developments and findings have been presented at more conferences than was originally intended. We we fortunate in that every abstract we submitted was accepted. This meant a lot of extra work in putting the presentations together, as well as the time to attend the conferences, but was worthwhile to get the project known about within relevant communities.0 CommentsPosted by Alison Felce at 17:34View this 'Thought'3rd Sept 2010 - ePCoP Project Meeting
