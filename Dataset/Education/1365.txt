CSaP's mission is to improve public policy through the more effective use of evidence and expertise. We do this by creating opportunities for public policy professionals and academics to learn from each other.
We convene our network to provide fresh perspectives and critical challenges to conventional thinking.
Through our workshops, Fellowships and research programme, we have pioneered new ways of bringing academia and public policy together.

Pathways to Impact
Helping academics explore the policy implications of their research.
We help academics increase the policy impact of their work by facilitating meaningful connections through our workshops and Fellowships.
Policy Workshops
Providing decision makers in government with an opportunity to test and shape their thinking.
Our workshops provide a forum to cross examine and re-evaluate issues that are of direct relevance to policy makers.
"Handling risk is a vital task for any government. By building timely and relevant connections between government and academia, the Centre for Science and Policy is making a significant contribution to improving the use of evidence in public policy."
Sir Mark Walport, Government Chief Scientific Adviser
What is CSaP?
CSaP works with a unique network of academics and decision-makers to improve the use of evidence and expertise in public policy. Our approach is based on addressing the questions which policy makers identify, and on building relationships characterised by mutual understanding, respect and trust.
