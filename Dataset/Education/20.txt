Introduction
This is a dictionary for all you people who have been reading through an
email message or news article and suddenly come across a completely alien
collection of letters. These are not usually a spelling mistake (well it
depends on whose message it is!) but one of the many acronyms. Computer
people love acronyms (collections of letters which stand for a phrase)
for instance PC, DOS, RISCOS etc. and comms people are no exception allocating
Acronyms to everyday phrases just to make the "newbie's" life more difficult!
Of course once you've mastered the acronyms there are still smilies :-)
and plenty of jargon to confuse you but these are beyond the scope of this
guide. This is not a complete list but I have put in all the acronyms I
have come across.
