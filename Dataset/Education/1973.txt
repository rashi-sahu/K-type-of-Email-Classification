What does Culture have to do with Climate Change? Everything.

The Issue
The climate challenge is a reality. Our societies have evolved over the past 200 years largely dependent on fossil fuel for energy. The CO2 emissions produced by burning these fuels are causing dangerous harm to our habitat and our health. This needs to be addressed with urgency.
Game Changer
We need a cultural shift in our ambition, behavior and values to build a sustainable future. Cape Farewell engages and inspires our greatest creative and visionary minds to work with scientists, clean-tech entrepreneurs, sociologists and designers to vision and help create the non-carbon society we must all aspire to.
Transformative Action
Cape Farewell changes the way we think about climate. Partnering with world-renowned institutions, we engage our international audiences with film, artworks, novels and public facing narratives to motivate a creative and sustainable future for us all. Cape Farewell has a strategic programme of activity to help build the low carbon culture we need.

How We Work
Arts
Art is at the core of Cape Farewell: one salient image, a novel or song can speak louder than volumes of scientific data and engage the public's imagination in an immediate way ›
Climate Science
Cape Farewell works closely with the IPPC and worldwide climate scientists to ensure we are informed with accuracy and current scientific modelling ›
Expeditions
We use the notion of expedition - Arctic, island, urban and conceptual - to interrogate the scientific, social and economic realities that lead to climate disruption ›
Education & Engagement
In courses, workshops and talks, and through educational resources we challenge and inspire people to think differently about climate change ›
Cape Farewell changes the way we think about climate change
How we measure our impact
Delivering internationally recognized high quality artwork
Assess the multiplier effect - how much media attention is generated.
Internet recognition; web site stats and increase of social media activity.
Quantify direct public engagement and the quality of that interaction through evaluations and tracking of audience numbers.
Reaching targeted demographics through tailor-made programmes and strong strategic partnerships.
Leadership - Cape Farewell is an internationally emulated model of best practice.
Publish papers / peer reviewed and subject of (academic) research worldwide.
Making social and natural (climate) science accessible and exciting to the wider public.
Creativity - we highly value creativity as a driver of cultural change.
Fun as a measure of success. Negativity is counterproductive.
