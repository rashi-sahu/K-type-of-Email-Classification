The Erewhon Project
The Erewhon project exists to research and develop methods of accessing University information and services from mobile devices whilst also creating a comprehensive geo-location database to facilitate the anticipated demand for location based services (LBS).
The core deliverables are:
Implementation of a geo-location data model, syndication interface, and API for organisational resources.
Provision of demonstration location-aware applications.
Adaptation of selected Sakai tools for use on relevant mobile devices.
Guidelines on effective use of mobile devices in UK HE/FE.

Erewhon is funded by the JISC (Joint Information Systems Committee) Institutional Innovation Programme from October 2008 to March
2010.
