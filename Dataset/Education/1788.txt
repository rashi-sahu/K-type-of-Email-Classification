The Museum
The collection is housed in what was once the foundry building of Whatley & Hiscock, agricultural engineers.
Indeed, the machinery of this firm formed the basis for the Heritage Centre. When engineering work ceased, the local history society set up a museum to conserve the heavy machinery. This has grown into the resource you can see today.
You will find more information about the history of the building and the collection in the Museum History section of this website.
Pewsey - the village that gave the Vale its name.
