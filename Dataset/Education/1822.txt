Rutland Local History and Record Society Welcome Page
Introduction
Welcome to the Web pages of Rutland Local History & Record Society.  The only society
for you if your interest is the history and people of England's smallest county, with its
Roman and Anglo-Saxon settlements, its castles, its former royal forest, its ancient
churches and stone-built villages and its two old market towns.
The Rutland Record Society, formed in 1979, combined in 1991 with the Rutland Local
History Society, founded in the 1930s, to form the Rutland Local History & Record
Society. In 1993, the Rutland Field Research Group for Archaeology & History, founded
in 1971, also amalgamated with the Society. The enlarged Society has a
world-wide membership.
Our Archaeological Group provides opportunities for all members to get involved with
real archaeology in Rutland - field-walking, metal detecting, surveying, research,
identification, preparation of reports, social events and more.
All our society publications are concerned with some aspect of Rutland's history.
They are listed and reviewed. "Rutland Record" is the Society's journal, published
annually and free to members.
The journal is a unique collection of historical articles about our ancient county.
Back copies for most years are available and we highlight most of the major articles.
Are you interested in the history of England's smallest county. Do you have the desire to
find out more about your Rutland town, village, hamlet, house or ancestors?
If so, why not join us?
