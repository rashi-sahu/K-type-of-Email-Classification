If you (or maybe your Grandfather) were at St Edwards College, Sandfield Park in the 1950s, then this is the place for you.
Feel free to wander around, either exploring the Big Pictures
(go on, click on the year of your choice)
of the entire school, picking an area of activity (rugby, cricket, athletics)
or maybe - and this is the best part - go to the pages compiled just for you and your classmates.
If you liked what you saw, and wished someone would do the same for your year, why not volunteer?
Just contact one of us via the Notice Board for any help on setting it up, or just to leave a message.
