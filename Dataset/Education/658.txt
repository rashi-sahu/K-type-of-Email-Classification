This JISC (the
Joint Information Systems
Committee) funded study will investigate how the introduction of
large-scale networked learning across an institution makes a difference to
the management of that institution. The project is being undertaken by a
partnership of UHI Millennium Institute, Bradford University and SFEU
(Scottish Further Education Unit). The study will investigate the impact
of large-scale networked learning on:
Management and administration
Quality assurance monitoring and evaluation
Staffing and collaboration
Development of learning resources
Infrastructure and student support services This is
a 12 months project starting in December 2002 with the final report and a
self-evaluation and guidance toolkit due to be published by the end of
2003. Further project details are available by navigating the menu on the
