EIDCSR aimed to develop and join up elements of research data infrastructure at
various points of the data lifecycle by improving research data workflows,
underpinned by the development of a University Data Management Policy.
EIDCSR worked with a
team of scientists generating and using very high resolution two-dimensional and
three-dimensional images of hearts in order to understand and help improve their
data preservation and curation processes. The Project was an intra-institutional
collaboration involving the Computing Services (who led the work), the Research
Services Office, the Bodleian Libraries, and the researchers themselves.
