Making the
History of Computing
relevant and fun!
welcome_to
The Centre for Computing History is a charitable, heritage organisation with a strong focus on learning. Much more than a museum, it hosts hands-on exhibitions, educational workshops and a wide range of activities and events. Most importantly, it makes the history of personal computing relevant and fun for all ages!
The history of computers is the history of our modern world. The Centre's aim is to increase understanding of developments in personal computing over the past 50 years.
We are located in Cambridge, and we hope you'll visit us very soon!
