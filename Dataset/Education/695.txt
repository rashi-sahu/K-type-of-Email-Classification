n. a JISC-funded project at Newcastle University
Institutional Data Management for Personalisation and Syndication
Introduction
IDMAPS addresses the problems posed by the organic development of diverse computing systems in Higher Education institutions, leading to data flows which are inconsistent, badly documented and hard to maintain.
The project will produce an exemplar institutional data infrastructure, associated data access policies and defined data interfaces. This will be based on Newcastle University's Campus Management system, and permit accurate and timely data management.
The benefits will be evaluated through pilots utilising this data infrastructure and exploiting Web 2.0 technologies, which will deliver rich personalised content to users via a variety of platforms.
Objectives
Investigate the nature and fitness-for-purpose of existing solutions
Determine institutional requirements
Specify a flexible, adaptable information architecture of core user data
Implement the data infrastructure and supporting systems
Specify and deploy interfaces to enable data exchange across systems
Demonstrate, document and disseminate project outputs
Anticipated Outputs
Best practice models for undertaking institutional data auditsTechnology demonstrator of the institutional data model
Fully documented exemplar service descriptions and policy framework
Data management policies published as reusable templates
Demonstrator of integrated systems using Web 2.0 technologies
