HANABI
HAndheld-device enhanced learning with Nintendo's Applications Beyond Institution and country
This one-year project, funded by JISC (The Joint Information Systems Commetee), is using Nintendo DSi hand-held games consoles to link students on exchange in Japan to co-students elsewhere in Japan and their tutors back home, including structured language learning exercises and feedback. The overall project will assess the use of advanced games consoles as a medium for delivering e-learning to communities of students learning Japanese but will also have significance for students of other non-European languages.
HANABI workshops in Japan, December 09
30 DSi consoles
Tokyo workshop
Kyoto workshop
There were two workshops, one in Tokyo and the other in Kyoto, held in December 09 for two purposes- 1. to give a Nintendo DSi console to each third year student in Japan  2. to give them a brief guidance on how to use the console and 'Ugoku Memocho' (Flipnote in English) application.
Please note that this is for the previous J3 students.
