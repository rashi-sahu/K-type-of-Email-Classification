Worcester Learning Box Repository Project
Welcome!
Visit our Symposium Event Main Page!
The Worcester Learning Box Repository Project is being carried out at the University of Worcester in partnership with the University of Southampton. The project is part-funded by JISC.
The overall aim is to start up a new learning materials repository at the university based on “Learning Box”, a fresh approach developed within the Faroes project at Southampton. The new approach is one involving a minimum of metadata, with as much of the management and access controlled by the users as much as possible, in the spirit of Web 2.0.
The project will run from 1 April 2009 – 31 May 2010
