Did you know South London Women’s Centre?
Posted on 3rd February 2017 Do you remember 14 Radnor Terrace in Lambeth? Were you a squatter during the 70s?
Did you see A Woman’s Place exhibition in 1974? Did you know any of the feminist artists who took part?
Naomi Pearce, Amy Budd and Amy Tobin are doing research for a forthcoming exhibition at Raven Row gallery into the history of Radnor Terrace in Lambeth, where South Lambeth Women’s Centre was, and which was the centre of a large lesbian squatting community in the mid-1970s. They are interested in hearing from anyone who was involved in the women’s centre or who remembers seeing the exhibition A Woman’s Place by artists and other women associated with the South London Art Group based at 14 Radnor Terrace. Information gathered will contribute to a publication on the A Woman’s Place exhibition. If you can help please contact Amy Budd at info@ravenrow.org
Greenham Common plate
Posted on 27th January 2017
This plate was recently donated to FAN. It is one of a limited series which was produced in the early 1980s by Australian artist Chris Conlon to commemorate the Greenham Common campaign.
The plates were made individually and each one was different. The motif on this one echoes themes of spinning and weaving, which were commonly used at Greenham. The word Greenham is etched on the reverse.
Feminist Archive North’s new website
Posted on 12th May 2016 It took us a while to get here, but our old website has finally been retired to the herstory archive. We hope you’ll find our new one more informative and easier to navigate. Some of the information remains the same – the chronology of the Women’s Liberation Movement, which we know many of you find an indispensable research tool, is still here – but some things are changing.
The launch of our new website coincides with a big change for FAN, one which we are very excited about. The catalogue of our collections has been moved over to Leeds University’s Special Collections online database, allowing anyone to search our collections and see what’s available. We know that this will make a big difference to the researchers who use FAN.
We will also be making regular posts, keeping you informed of FAN activities, relevant events and new additions to our collections, or to highlight interesting items that have been donated.
