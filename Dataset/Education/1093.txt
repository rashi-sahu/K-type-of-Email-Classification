Introduction
The overall objective of the ROADS project was to design and
implement a user-oriented resource discovery system. It
investigated the creation, collection and distribution of resource
descriptions, to provide a transparent means of searching for, and
using resources. The object was not to create an individual and
idiosyncratic system but to draw on, and help create, standards of
good practice which could be widely adopted by subject communities
to aid and automate the process of resource organisation and
discovery. A primary goal was interworking with other national and
international services, and partners are active in Internet
Engineering Task Force working groups and UK and international
consensus-making bodies at technical, service and organisational
levels.
