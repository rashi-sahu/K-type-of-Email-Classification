Anglia Ruskin University's Institutional Repository
Anglia Ruskin Research Online (ARRO) was launched in June 2010 with the aim of showcasing and preserving the research outputs of members of the Anglia Ruskin research community. It provides – where permissions allow – free and open access to the scholarly outputs of staff from across the University.
Why deposit your work in ARRO?
Alongside the considerable benefits of making your work open (including improved visibility and higher impact), open access is now vital for meeting the requirements of many research funders.
HEFCE's policy on open access requires that to be eligible for the next REF, journal articles and conference proceedings accepted for publication from 1st April 2016 must be deposited in an open access repository within 3 months of acceptance (see more detail on HEFCE's policy).
Anglia Ruskin University's policy on open access expects that all research outputs will be deposited in ARRO.
How do I deposit my work?
Uploading to ARRO is quick and easy!
To get started, visit: arro.anglia.ac.uk and log on with your Anglia username and password.
Once you have logged on you will be prompted to upload a copy of your output (usually your final author accepted manuscript, rather than the publisher's PDF) and complete some brief information about your publication (e.g. author, title, journal).
What happens next?
All outputs submitted to ARRO will be checked by Library staff before being made live. The Library will make sure that the version supplied meets the publisher's archiving policy and also set any embargo periods which might apply.
How can I get help?
See our brief guide on how to deposit a journal article.
For further assistance, please email: arro@anglia.ac.uk or ian.walker@anglia.ac.uk.
