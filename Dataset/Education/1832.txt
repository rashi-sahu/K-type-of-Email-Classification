Welcome to Seven Stories - The National Centre for Children's Books
Save • Celebrate • Share
Seven Stories is the National home of Children's Books. There is no other place like it in the UK. Everything we do celebrates children's books, their creators and their readers.  Many of the best loved books for children are written by British authors and illustrators, changing the lives of those who read and enjoy them. We select original artwork and manuscripts - from first scribbles to finished books - to create our innovative exhibitions and popular events.
Seven Stories' unique exhibitions, lively events and playful activities bring children's books to life - every day for everyone - making us a place to remember.
