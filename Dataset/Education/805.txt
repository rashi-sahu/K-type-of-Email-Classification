"LORO is a JISC/OU funded project to provide a repository of teaching and learning materials for the Department of Languages at the Open University. The repository will provide a space for users to store, share and manage their own resources and will allow them access to a wide range of resources for different languages and levels. It is aimed at staff involved in the production and delivery of languages courses, i.e. central academics, staff tutors and associate lecturers. LORO will also be linked and contribute some of its material to the wider subject repository Language Box.
The project started in April 2009 and will run until the end of June 2010."
