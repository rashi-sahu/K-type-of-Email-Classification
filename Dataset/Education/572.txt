FUTURAGE is a two-year project funded by the
European Commission, under the Seventh Framework Programme, to create the
definitive road map for ageing research in Europe
for the next 10-15 years.
Drawing on experts and specialists from Europe and beyond, the road map will represent the most
extensive consultation ever conducted in this field and identify the main
priorities on ageing and health from a multi-disciplinary perspective.
Through a chain of events, academic and non-academic stakeholders
will engage in a state-of-the-art assessment of research priorities, emerging
fields and methods to build consensus on the research priorities in ageing
until 2025.
View a short introductory video.
The FUTURAGE project was completed in December 2011.  All materials will remain accessible online, including the Road Map for European Ageing Research.
