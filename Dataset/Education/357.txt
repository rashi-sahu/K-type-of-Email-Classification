The DIDET Project
Digital Libraries for Global Distributed Innovative Design, Education
and Teamwork
The DIDET Project (2003-2008) was led by the University
of Strathclyde, Stanford University
and Olin College to enhance learning
opportunities by enabling students to participate in global team-based
design engineering projects that give them experience of working within
multi-cultural contexts and enable them to develop global design team
working skills. The project has disseminated widely on the classroom
model and wiki-based system (learning environment and digital library)
developed to transform the education process for Design Engineering. The Evaluation section of our website
gives details of methodologies and key findings
relating to the work of the DIDET Project.
The project concluded in 2008 to high acclaim, please see the 'About' Section for more details about the project, its achievements, the project framework and links to the Final Report with conclusions and recommendations relating to the project.
