Project Description
An international, multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary team of researchers will jointly explore authorship across three distinct datasets: a collection of digitised 15th-century manuscripts, a collection of 17th- and 18th-century digitized maps and a collection of 19th- and 20th-century digitized quilts.
The topic of authorship is one of the common research questions in multiple disciplines of humanities, arts and social sciences that unites the underlying image analyses to be undertaken. Our research seeks to investigate the accuracy and computational scalability of adaptive image analyses when it is applied to diverse collections of image data while driven by the same overarching question of authorship. The objective of this proposal is:
To design image analysis algorithms that will extract salient image features, group together images based on similarity of these features, classify groups according to a priori knowledge, optimize algorithmic steps and parameters
To apply the algorithms jointly developed to all the aforementioned collections of images
To report accuracy and computational requirements over all of the image collections
Duration: January 2010 – March 2011
