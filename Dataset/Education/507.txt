EAT-PDP – engaging alumni
through personal development planning
The EAT-PDP project will
prove the link between effective and on-going web-based Personal Development
Planning (PDP) and the creation of a mutually beneficial alumni relationship, by
incentivising the involvement in, and promoting the value of, the PDP process.
In cooperation with the Unit for the Enhancement of Learning and Teaching
(UELT), Kent Innovation and Enterprise (KIE), Alumni Relations Office (ARO) and
Careers Advisory Service (CAS) we will address the full student lifecycle by
identifying the reusable entities created in the PDP process and exposing them
appropriately.
The project will also serve as a practical case study extension
of the JISC funded Logins for Life project, which will highlight and provide
measures to mitigate the risk of providing services to the alumni
community.
