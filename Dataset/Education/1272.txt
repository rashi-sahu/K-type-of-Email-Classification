University of Derby Assessment Centre
At UDAC we carry out study needs assessments for UK students eligible for Disabled Students' Allowance (DSA)
At the University of Derby Assessment Centre (UDAC) we carry out study needs assessments for UK students eligible for Disabled Students' Allowance (DSA) aiming to study at here or any other university.
You may be entitled to apply for DSA if you have:
a disability,
a specific learning difficulty – like dyslexia,
an on-going health condition,
a mental-health condition.
Needs assessments take place at our Buxton and Derby campuses. We also have partnerships with other universities where assessments are carried out and issued through UDAC. If this is impractical Assessments may be conducted at alternative locations to meet the needs of the student. UDAC is registered and certified with Disabled Students Allowances Quality Assurance Group (DSA-QAG) and is a member of the National Network of Assessment Centres (NNAC).
Students' Allowance
DSA is funding that can help with equipment, assistive software, support workers and travel. Students must be able to provide formal evidence of their disability, to obtain permission to assess. UDAC Assessment centre will charge students a single assessment fee, which will cover all work required for the duration of course study. For help with applying for DSA, please contact the Disability Officer at your university.
Timescales
We're currently able to offer assessments to students who have received formal approval to assess from Student Finance England, within 15 working days of contact with UDAC.
Please complete the UDAC Pre-assessment form and return by email to udac@derby.ac.uk along with your eligibility letter and medical evidence.
UDAC is open from Monday to Friday 9.00-4.30T: 01298 330 312F: 01298 330 730
