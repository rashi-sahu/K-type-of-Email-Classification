Advocacy for OpenSpires
"In the late-19th century Oxford was one of the pioneers of the university extension movement, which enabled audiences around the UK to hear what some of its lecturers had to say on a wide range of topics. The OpenSpires project is the 21st-century equivalent, though, with the benefit of the web, the audiences are now global and we hope even more diverse. It is a pleasure to contribute to this important venture, which is opening up Oxford like never before."
Peter D. McDonald, St Hugh's College, Oxford

"Building on from Oxford's successful iTunes/podcast series, OpenSpires aims
to make the work of the university available online, a worthwhile endeavour to
disseminate educational content to a wider audience. I am pleased to take part,
including via 'The Credit Crunch and Global Recession' series that features topical
analysis of the issues debated during this global recession and recovery."
Linda Y. Yueh, College Fellow & Tutor in Economics, St Edmund Hall, Oxford
