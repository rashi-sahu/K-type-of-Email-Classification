About
Welcome to the project blog for Manufacturing Pasts – a JISC funded project which created digital resources to enhance the learning and teaching of British industrial history during the second half of the twentieth century.
The Manufacturing Pasts website created by this project, benefits students, lecturers and public organizations with a stake in Britain’s industrial past by providing them with access to a range of open educational resources (OERs) and associated digitized historical sources.
All these resources can be freely reused and adapted for non-commercial use.  They use the city of Leicester to illustrate the changing experience of British manufacturing and its impact on urban society, landscape and environment across the twentieth century.
Between November 2011 and January 2013, the project created:
A fully searchable and openly accessible digitized collection of unique photographs, documents and architectural drawings of Leicester factories and industrial communities in the twentieth century
A range of open educational resources (OERs) based on the digitized resources which enable their practical use in the teaching of twentieth-century British history, planning and urban conservation.
Dr. Rebecca Madgin of the University of Leicester’s Centre for Urban History introduces the project:
The project was a collaboration between the Beyond Distance Research Alliance,  Centre for Urban History and the Library at the University of Leicester and the Record Office for Leicestershire, Leicester and Rutland.
