The Biota of Early Terrestrial Ecosystems: The Rhynie Chert
has now been translated into Belorussian by Patric Conrad.
The
Proceedings of The
Rhynie Hot-Spring
System: Geology, Biota and Mineralisation conference have now been
published.
In July 2004
we exhibited at the
Royal
Society's Summer Science Exhibition! Our exhibit was entitled
'410
million
years ago in Scotland: Fossils from the Rhynie chert'.

About this site
This web site is designed
as a learning and teaching resource
based on the Rhynie chert, a rock formation from northeast Scotland
that contains a superbly
preserved 400 million year old terrestrial and freshwater flora and
fauna. The site is designed
to be of greatest value for Honours Geology students but can be used by
anyone with an interest in earth or life sciences. The site comprises
two main
components:
The Learning
Resource
The first is primarily a
resource site for students and
teachers covering many aspects of the present knowledge of this unique
geological deposit and its scientific significance. It also includes
glossary and bibliography pages, as well as a page containing links to
many other Rhynie chert websites and related sites of interest (to
enter this site click on the icon above left).
Suggestions
For Tutors
The second part provides guidance for teachers in this subject area. It is
primarily aimed
at a university  Honours degree level but can be utilised at
any
level. The content is primarily of value in geology teaching, but has
relevance to botany, zoology, ecology and history of science (to enter

Partnerships
This teaching and
learning resource has been funded by the Joint
Information Systems Committee.
It has been authored by the
Rhynie chert Research Group, University of Aberdeen, UK (see list of
authors below) with contributions
and support by the Palaeobotanical
Research Group, University of Münster, Germany,
the Centre
for Palynology, University of Sheffield, UK, The
Natural History Museum, London, UK
and The
Royal Museum, National
Museums of Scotland.
