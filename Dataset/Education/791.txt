About the Kultur II Group
The JISC-funded Kultur project brought together the University of Southampton, University of the Arts London, University for the Creative Arts, and the Visual Arts Data Service. Leiden University was an associate partner.
The partners developed a model for repository start-up addressing the needs of the UK higher education arts sector including non-text and practice-led research outputs.
The Kultur II Group now consists of participants of the
kultur@jiscmail.ac.uk list, a closed email list set-up during the Kultur project, and attendees of the meetings held after the end of the Kultur project from 1st October 2009 to current.
The Group is open to all specialist creative arts institutions, departments within larger multidisciplinary institutions, and researchers in the UK. We welcome repository managers and administrators, researchers, librarians, technical staff, academics, and research office staff.
Members of the Kultur II Group have shared their details on the Contacts page.
