Managing research data
Research data is the information that underpins your research findings. It comes in an endless variety of formats, depending on your discipline. If you're new to the topic research data management don't worry - much of what's involved should be familiar: saving work in a format that can be re-opened easily, naming files so they can be found quickly, backing up valuable data and controlling who has access to it.
Making the most of your research data can help increase the impact of your research and maximises the value of public investment. In addition, many research funders and academic publishers now have requirements around research data.
To learn the fundamentals of research data management, take our Bootcamp interactive tutorial. To learn how the Research Data Service can support researchers in planning, creating, using and sharing research data, explore the rest of our site.
