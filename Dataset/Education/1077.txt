Welcome to the RATATAT Project Website
The JISC funded RATATAT project (Remote Access To Academic Trials And Testing) is based at Swansea Metropolitan University and aims to provide remote access for Masters Degree students to sophisticated laboratory experiments as part of an online course.
The issue that the project addresses is common to a number of specialist skills areas where the role of the specialist is crucial to an industry sector, but the total number of specialists needed is relatively limited. This leads to the problem that viable campus-based cohorts of postgraduate students studying the specialist skills can only be assembled if students travel significant distances to participate. This does happen, as in the case of the NDT courses at Swansea Metropolitan University, but it is at significant financial expense of the employers and significant personal time commitment by the students who are employees of those companies.
The project will explore how emerging web 2.0 technologies and existing computer communications technologies can be combined to allow students to carry out sophisticated practical laboratory assignments online.
The Ratatat project was funded by    as part of the Learning and Teaching Innovation Grant Programme
