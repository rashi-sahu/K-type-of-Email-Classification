The Videos showing potential students where the college facilities are, are finally finishedâ€¦â€¦.Â  I decided visual guidesÂ explaining how to locateÂ the facilities in the college would be more helpful and give potential students a clearer representative of what is available in our college.Â  Reading through screens of text can be tiresome.Â  Hopefully these videos will portray a clearer picture.Â  We have some videos in YouTube, but, having them all linked in a logical mannerÂ from one central sourceÂ should hopefully make them easier to follow.Â  Now, I just have to get it all together ðŸ™‚
