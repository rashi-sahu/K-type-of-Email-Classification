Overview
The JAFER Project (Java Access For Electronic Resources) was a Jisc funded project (2000 - 2003) based at Oxford University to produce an easy to use toolkit for building portals and information sources without having to deal with the technical intricacies of the Z39.50 protocol.
ANSI/NISO Z39.50 defines a standard protocol for communication and information retrieval between computers, typically over a network. It provides standard ways to search distributed databases, and to retrieve full-text documents, bibliographic data, images and multimedia, and can be implemented on any computer platform.
