Wayne Westwood
British Wildlife Artist (b.1964)

Driven purely by his own passion and self-discipline, Wayne has dedicated himself to the creation of spectacular wildlife art. His paintings have been featured in various magazines, including Birds Illustrated and Countryman's Weekly, firmly establishing him as one of Britain's leading wildlife artists.
