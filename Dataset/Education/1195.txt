Research participants wanted
I am Chuxue Liang and a third year student at the University of Sussex. I’m looking for international students as participants to complete an anonymous online survey about international students’ acculturative experiences. The study highlights the experiences of international students about their residential life, daily dietary, language, socialisation, and religion.If you are interested in taking part, please visit: http://tinyurl.com/j9xfvys
Thank you for your help!!
Chuxue LiangFull details…We seek healthy non-smokers aged 18 to 50 to study the effects of inflammation on memory and links to blood-brain barrier permeability. We offer compensation up to £75 for the whole study. It involves 3 visits. The first visit is to explain the study, gain consent and take some blood. At the next 2 visits you will have more blood tests and either a saline injection or typhoid vaccination (all participants have both during the study), then an MRI scan and memory tests. Recruitment ends May 2017.Full details… View all research ads | Add research ad
