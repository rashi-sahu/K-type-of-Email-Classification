Welcome
This is the website for the JISC funded project Making Assessment Count (MAC). This project is a collaboration between the School of Biosciences and the University's Learning, Teaching and Development Centre. The MAC project will use existing technologies at Westminster to improve the student experience in the School of Biosciences initially but it is hoped that the outcomes of the work will be readily transferable to other subject areas.
Outline Project Description
This project will work closely with another project funded by the JISC at Westminster. The TWOLER project is looking at the use of google apps by students
The MAC project is funded by the Joint Information Systems Committee (jISC) as part of its programme to transform curriculum delivery through the use of technology.
