Library History Special Interest Group
Sponsoring body: Library Theory and Research
Scope
This Special Interest Group is the continuation (as of 2009) of the former Library History Section. It aims to be the means within IFLA by which professionals specializing in all fields of librarianship can be made aware of the importance of an understanding of the past and of the profession's theoretical foundations to the successful provision of library services in the present and future. In particular, the SIG concentrates on universal and broad themes of library history, regional or international or local experience of general significance.
