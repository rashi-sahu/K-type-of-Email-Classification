The S.O.U.R.C.E. project
The SOURCE project was a two year JISC funded project (Oct 2006 - Oct 2008) working on "opening up the content marketplace", which means we are (still) here to help migrate stuff from one platform to another by providing  bulk-migration tools and architectures.  We do this because we believe content should never be stuck in a single platform (or repository) and that everyone should be free to pick the platform that will deliver their content to their users the best.  Why? Often times institutions "buy into" a platform thinking it has the technology they need for there users, yet as their users change often a better platform comes along that could do the job better (know as 'disruptive innovation'). But don't worry, the SOURCE project is here to help (even beyond the funding of the project)!
First off, we can provide advice on which platforms will not put your content in a deep dark hole where you can never get at it again.  Secondly, we can provide migration tools and libraries that will help you get your content out of your legacy platform and into a new platform.  Have a browse around our website here to see what we might offer.  Though the project is ended we have created a good chunk of code and are more than happy to share advice, thoughts and experience... or if you just in the mood for a good ole chat about APIs and what a pain in the @r$e they are please don't hesitate to contact us.
