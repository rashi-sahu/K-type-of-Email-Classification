The Churchill Archives Centre is a world-leading collection of 20th Century history.
“The aim of this venture is to make the College a major centre of historical research into
what might be termed the Churchill Era, where scholars will be able to find a great mass
of inter-related material gathered together under a single roof.”
Sir John Cockcroft, Master of Churchill, 14 July 1967
Purpose-built in 1973 to house Sir Winston Churchill's Papers, the Churchill Archives Centre is now home to the papers of almost 600 important political, military and scientific figures from the Churchill era and after. Contemporaries of Winston Churchill sit alongside major political, military and scientific figures such as: Margaret Thatcher, Ernest Bevin, John Major, Neil Kinnock, Admiral Ramsay, Field Marshal Slim, Frank Whittle and Rosalind Franklin.
Situated within the grounds of Churchill College, itself the national and Commonwealth memorial to Sir Winston, the Archives Centre is a valuable academic and cultural research hub. Its collections form one of the country’s most important sources for twentieth-century British history. The Archives Centre's mission is to preserve and make available to the public the unique materials in its care.
