Welcome to the PeerPigeon Website
PeerPigeon was a JISC sponsered project that ran within the Learning Societies Lab from March to September, 2007.
PeerPigeon aimed to produce a set of services for the e-Framework that would deal with Peer Review (or Peer Assessment), in particular the process of moving resources between peers according to a Peer Review Plan. In the end the project produced a working Peer Review infrastructure, implemented in Ruby, that uses a Ruby script to manage to logic of the peer review process. We are currently in the process of setting up a permanent PeerReview site, where the PeerPigeon service will be available. In the meantime you may be interested in the following resources:
