Arts on Film Archive offers on-line access to a large range of films on art produced in the United Kingdom since the 1950s, and is a unique record of British and international post-war art, as well as of
documentary film-making in the UK. Many titles in the collection contain rare material about individual artists, while others offer definitive coverage of their subject. The archive is an invaluable primary research resource for a wide range of scholars in arts and humanities. Its films contain valuable source material for biographies, monographs, and many other forms of research in art history and documentary film-making. The archive was built with the support of the Arts and Humanities Research Council at the School of Media Arts and Design of the University of Westminster: Dr Joram ten Brink - archive director; Elaine Burrows - database and catalogue; Steve Foxon - film restoration and encoding.
In its first phase, the archive offers a complete database and an
on-line video streaming of all 450 films made by the film department of Arts Council England between 1953 and 1998 and several films produced till 2003 by the dance Department of ACE.
