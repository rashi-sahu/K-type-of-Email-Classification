Welcome to the FAROES Project Website
The Faroes' repository - The Language Box is live!
The Language Box site is open and ready for you to use. The Faroes team is actively supporting the site and our philosophy is one of perpetual beta, so you should see minor changes and new features over time.
The Faroes project was a JISC funded initiative to create a community repository for Language teachers to share their teaching resources. Our aim was to create a lightweight repository that they can incorporate into their everyday practice, with a user interface that follows the best-practice principles of Web 2.0 sites (social, interlinked, evolving and flexible).
Faroes completed at the end of March 2009, however the Language Box is a live site and is being supported through the new OneShare project.
