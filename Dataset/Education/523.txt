European Election Study (EES) Trend File
This is a beta version of a set of pages explaining and making available the
data from European Parliament election studies run in almost all EU countries in
1989, 1994, 1999 and 2004.
All these files are saved as Stata files.
Also available is the   trend file "trendEES.dta". This  contains ONLY the
variables that appear in more than one EES study (year). There is also a
combined EES file ("combinedEES.dta"). This contains ALL of the variables from
all four EES studies.
These are also made available as SPSS files, but
there are no do-it-yourself SPSS command files that combine the basic EES
files in any way. This trend dataset can also be created by placing the four
individual EES data files (1989, 1994, 1999, 2004) in the same working directory
as the Stata file "trendEES.do", and then running that file. Obviously a user
could adapt that script to produce a wider or narrower selection of variables
within the trend file. A user can also generate this by running the script
"trendEES.do. This puts such a file called ("combinedEES.dta") in the working
directory.
There is another Stata file "Political Parties Link
File.dta". This contains within it unique party identifier codes in the Trend
data et with corresponding codes from the CMP project, Euromanifestos, ZEUS
codes from the Eurobarometer Trend File and PPMD dta file collected by Benoit
and Laver.
The EES trend file is currently in the `beta' testing mode,
so bugs are still most likely to be present. With feedback from `beta' version
testers these bugs can fixed quickly.
