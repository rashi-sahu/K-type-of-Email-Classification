Student Generated Content for Learning (SGC4L)
Welcome to the website for the SGC4L project - Student-Generated Content for Learning. This is a JISC-funded project under their Assessment and Feedback programme and aims to evaluate the use of PeerWise use in undergraduate course in Physics, Chemistry and Biology.
About the project
The project ran from September 2011 for one year
It is funded as one of the projects in Strand B of JISCs Assessment and Feedback programme
Project team
Project officer: Alison Kay
School of Physics and Astronomy: Simon Bates (PI); Judy Hardy; Ross Galloway
School of Chemistry: Colin Pulham, Peter Kirsop
School of Biological Sciences Heather McQueen
Since the start of the project, we have also begun collaborations with the following colleagues in other Schools at Edinburgh and at other institutions using PeerWise:
Paul Anderson School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh
Morag Casey School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Glasgow
Kyle Galloway School of Chemistry, University of Nottingham
Karen Smith Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of British Columbia.
