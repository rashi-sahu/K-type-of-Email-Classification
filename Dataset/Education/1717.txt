UKOLN - MODELS: MOving to Distributed Environments for Library Services
MODELS
MOving to Distributed Environments for Library Services
Introduction
MODELS (1995-2000) was a UKOLN initiative supported by the Electronic Libraries Programme and the British Library. It was motivated by the
recognised need to develop an applications framework to manage the rapidly multiplying range of distributed heterogeneous
information resources and services being offered to libraries and their users. Without an appropriate framework, use of networked
information cannot be as effective as it should be. MODELS provided a forum within which the UK library and information
communities could explore shared concerns, address design and implementation issues, initiate concerted actions, and work towards
a shared view of preferred systems and architectural solutions. The project manager was Rosemary Russell and project director Lorcan Dempsey.
