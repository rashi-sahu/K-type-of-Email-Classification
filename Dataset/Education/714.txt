SDI Report
IGIBS Followon and use of Underspend
Dec 202011
Its a bit early to be making predictions about how IGIBS might evolve, but a recent presentation to the EDINA geoteam followed by some discussion indicated some of the possibilities. The WMS Factory Tool.  With the simple but effective styling capability that Michael Koutroumpas engineered, I think we have a prototype thats not too far […]

INSPIRE and Universities: An update thanks to James Reid
Oct 102011
After some fantastic help from James Reid at EDINA we thought to put together a blog post summarising some of the conclusions we have come to over INSPIRE. At this stage it may be  worth having a look at my earlier but less informed post regarding INSPIRE to understand how my understanding of the issues has […]

Map Library becomes digital……
Oct 032011
Last week at IGES we had a rebirth of the map library as it became digital. This probably sounds more dramatic than it was.  What we did was to create a new drive on the public network for IGES staff and students   with a structured directory and put on some spatial data that relates to […]

DCC Roadshow Oxford
Sep 262011
Below is a copy of a blog entry I put on the DCC website after attending their Roadshow in September ……   As a rather out-of-practice ecologist I was looking forward to the DCC Roadshow with a little trepidation. Would the material be aimed at digital curators writing code to fine tune their repository functionality?  Or […]

WMS Access Control within IGIBS
Sep 202011
One of the goals of IGIBS is to allow users to generate protected WMS services using SAML-based access control. The technology behind this is based on  prior research done in the past few years by EDINA for the EU funded ESDIN project. The ideas produced by the project have been successfully tested within the OGC […]

Web-based Cartography for the IGIBS WMS Factory tool
Sep 162011
One of the main challenges in creating a WMS factory tool is to provide an intuitive way for end users to specify the rendering rules for the data they upload. Significant progress has already been made within IGIBS in calculating on-the-fly the minimum/maximum scale which is adequate for raster data. However, The cartographic rules mandatory […]

Meeting with EDINA and DCC staff in Edinburgh
Sep 052011
I was fortunate enough to have a meeting with some people from EDINA and the DCC in Edinburgh on Wednesday. The aim of the meeting was to get some input and advice from some experts on the ideas I have for a spatial data management best practice report.  So a big  thank you to Martin Donnelly […]
