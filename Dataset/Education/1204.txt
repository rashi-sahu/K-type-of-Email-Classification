Introduction
The SURF X4L Project is a project involving
Staffordshire University, Stoke-on-Trent FE College, Shrewsbury College of Art
and Technology and The Royal National College for the Blind. The project
concentrates on the repurposing of content for use within MLEs/VLEs and
focuses on the various phases needed to enable this to take place effectively.
These phases will involve formulating necessary
procedures, and the subsequent training of both support and teaching staff to
allow them to carry out:
a)    the identification and acquisition of content including its
existing metadata where this exists
b)    the use of tools for the packaging of content, which employ the
appropriate international specifications and standards (for example IMS and
SCORM), to capture material and add additional metadata where required
c)    further use these of tools to disaggregate and re-aggregate the
content and create standard content packages and import them into VLEs for
unpack aging and repurposing; where the VLE allows it, use the VLE for
further desegregation, reaggregation and repurposing to support courses
within the VLE.   This might include the export of VLE content to CD to
assist with off-line working.
d)    the packaging of repurposed content (again using international
specifications and standards) for export to digital repositories and further
reuse
The project will focus on the vast amount of learning content held on HEI
and FEI intranets and web servers which is not currently easily accessible for
repurposing and which requires description and packaging for VLE use, as well
as content from the DNER and other national non-commercial providers.
