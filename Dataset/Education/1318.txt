TELSTAR
The TELSTAR (Technology Enhanced Learning supporting STudents to achieve Academic Rigour) project ran from November 2008 to July 2010. It was run by the Open University and funded under the UK Higher Education Joint Information Systems Committee’s Institutional Innovation Programme (Phase 2 – Large-scale Institutional Exemplars). The Project was carried out in collaboration with RefWorks-COS.
This website (http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/telstar) originally hosted the project blog, and now hosts the archived blog and the “Reference Management Integration Toolkit” (ReMIT). The project blog posts can now be accessed using the ‘Archived blog posts’ option on the righthand side of this page.
The key outputs of the projects are:
Open source code for integrating reference management tools into the Moodle online learning platform
A toolkit for those looking at integrating reference management tools into their learning environment ‘ReMIT’, including a detailed description of the OU approach
For more details see:

The Final Report of the project may also be of interest, and will be available on the TELSTAR project page on the JISC website once published.
