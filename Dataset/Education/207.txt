The CAVA (human Communication: an Audio-Visual Archive) Repository is a digital video repository to support the work of the international human communication research community. This resource enhances the discoverability and re-usability of expensively-created, specialist video content, for the benefit of the community of human communication researchers worldwide.
The CAVA repository houses data including
young typically-developing children
children with hearing impairments
children with language impairments
people with aphasia
the British Sign Language Corpus
CAVA is a collaboration between several UCL Departments and Research Centres and the UK Data Archive (UKDA).
UCL Library Services
The UCL Research Department of Developmental Science
The UCL Research Department of Language and Communication
The UCL Centre for Human Communication
The original CAVA project was co-funded by UCL and the JISC (Joint Information Systems Committee, UK).
CAVA ran from 01 April 2009 to 31 August 2010. For more information, see About CAVA or read the final project report.
Video resources in the CAVA repository are described using a subset of the IMDI metadata standard. Transcripts and other supporting material, where available, are deposited alongside the videos. Access to the repository content is restricted to bona fide researchers.
