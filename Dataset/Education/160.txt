UCL Centre for Publishing
Situated within the Department of Information Studies,
the Centre is strongly placed to work with colleagues in related (and
increasingly more collaborative) disciplines such as information
science, digital humanities, and library and archive studies. The
Centre's location in central London makes it an ideal base for
collaboration with organisations outside UCL which connect to
publishing, such as app developers, bookshops, museums, galleries,
libraries and archives.We offer a research-led MA in Publishing,
which allows students to pursue a close professional study of trade and
academic publishing today. The course offers opportunities to look
at STM, journal and open access publishing, and there is a strong
emphasis on the digital aspects of publishing in its widest sense.
