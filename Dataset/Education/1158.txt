About
sapir
The University of Newcastle
has already established a Shibboleth
origin as part of the Core-middleware
IAMSECT project,
and this work will be built upon in order to
widen the use of Shibboleth within
the institution.
The University
Library has developed a large
portfolio of electronic resources
with all the complexities of
authentication and authorisation
that this involves. The Athens access
management system has helped to simplify access issues
to an extent, but the fact that Shibboleth is an international
standard inevitably means it is in the interests of institutions
to investigate the practicalities
of implementing this new method of access with commonly-used
resources while at the same time clearly documenting
the issues that may arise, and helping the community
with future developments. In addition to this, the work
will look at other commonly used resources and resource
management tools.
