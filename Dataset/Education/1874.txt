Welcome!
Westminster's wartime story can now be told on the West End at War website, thanks to a £50,000 Heritage Lottery (HLF) Grant. The website forms part of a larger project which has been put together to mark the 70th anniversary of the Blitz. The website features previously-unseen colour film, summaries of bomb incidents, eyewitness accounts and a large collection of contemporary art works commissioned to record the impact of the Blitz on this famous London Borough.A large part of this website has been put together by volunteers. By registering with us you too can contribute to our growing website.
