The I2S2 Project (Archived Site)
The I2S2 project has ended and consequently this website is no longer being maintained
The
Infrastructure for Integration in Structural Sciences (I2S2) Project
is funded under the Research Data Management Infrastructure strand of
the JISC's Managing Research Data Programme, with a duration of
18 months (Oct 2009 to March 2011).
I2S2 will identify requirements for a data-driven research infrastructure in "Structural Science",
focusing on the domain of Chemistry, but with a view towards inter-disciplinary application.
I2S2 will develop use cases that explore perspectives of scale and complexity and
research discipline throughout the data lifecycle.
Two research data management pilots based on the use cases, will examine the business
processes of research, and highlight the benefits of an integrated approach.
Both pilots will address traversing administrative boundaries
between institutions to national facilities in addition to issues of scale
(local laboratory to national facilities, DIAMOND synchrotron and ISIS respectively).
Pilot 2 in particular, will apply the approach to Earth Sciences and demonstrate the benefit to
scientific disciplines other than Chemistry.
A key component of the infrastructure will be a harmonised Integrated Information Model to include all
stages of the Data Life Cycle.
A "before and after" cost-benefit analysis will be performed
using the Keeping Research Data Safe (KRDS2) model, which will be extended to address
inter-disciplinary requirements in I2S2.
