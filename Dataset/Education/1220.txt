Welcome to the Website of the JISC-funded SWANI Project
The SWANI Project has now concluded its work and all the outcomes are available on this site. The aim of the SWANI* project was to create a fully online work-based learning management and learner support system that met the audit requirements of the EU and the Welsh Assembly Government. It also aimed to deliver a system that was significantly more time-efficient and cost-effective to deliver than the existing paper-based system.
The specific objectives of the SWANI project were to:
Create a fully online management, administrative and learner support system for work-based learners;
Implement a digital signature system that satisfies the audit requirements of the EU and the Welsh Assembly Government;
Carry out a trial of the online system to evaluate and quantify the benefits
The key outcomes of the SWANI project were:
A fully digitised, online, work-based learning administrative and management system based on open source and web 2.0 applications;
A digital signature system that is acceptable for audit purposes by the European Commission and the Welsh Assembly Government.
It is envisaged that the new online system will be of value to all institutions delivering work-based learning, particularly where an audit trail of learner achievement that triggers funding is involved.
This website provides access to all the working documents for the SWANI project, and allows downloadsÂ of all the key project deliverables that are of interest to the JISC community.
*The acronym SWANI stands for Secure Work-based learning Administration through Networked Infrastructure.
