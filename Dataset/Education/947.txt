FAQ
Open Source Options for Education
Updated 03/01/2014 Looking for
open source alternatives to closed source software? We maintain a list of options for
open source software for use in the education sector for everything from
libraries and administration systems to subject-specific teaching tools.
Wherever possible we also link to real-life examples and case studies of
use by educators and institutions.
Openness Rating
Is your software open or fauxpen? This is the question that OSS Watch, in partnership with Pia Waugh, developed the Openness Rating to help you find out.
Using a series of questions covering legal issues, governance, standards, knowledge sharing and market access, the tool helps you to identify potential problem areas for users, contributors and partners.
Get started with the Openness Rating tool.
