A
project funded under the JISC DIVLE (07/02) Programme
The University of Ulster was granted funding from the Joint Information
Systems Committee (JISC) to further develop a working model upon
which to fully integrate its VLE and library systems. This work
was be undertaken in 2002/3 to provide WebCT users with personalised
contextual linkages to library resources and services along with
seamless access to protected resources. The 4i Project (Interoperable,
Institutional, Integrated, Implementation), builds on preliminary
development work undertaken in 2001/2 and has scaled up these activities
in order to assess the impact of an institution wide VLE-Library
system integration on library business processes and the user experience.
It also seeks to inform further development of technical integration
methods to facilitate better interoperability between diverse systems
and platforms. This is being conducted throught the IMS
forum.
The
project is part of the JISC's Linking
Digital Libraries with VLE's (DiVLE) programme pedagogical and
organisational issues of linking digital library systems and virtual
learning environments.
