FREE ENTRY
The Museum stands in the centre of the historic city of Lichfield, which remained close to Johnson's heart throughout his life. Best known for his Dictionary of the English Language, Johnson spent the first 27 years of his life in the large, imposing house which overlooks Market Square, frequently returning until shortly before his death in 1784.
The Grade 1 listed building contains a varied mix of displays, reconstructed rooms and audio-visual media.
Visitors are taken through the colourful life and major achievements of Lichfield's most famous son, from troubled childhood, through literary obscurity and financial poverty, to world renown and success.
Our growing calendar of special events means that visitors can come again and again to see the wonderful house in a variety of guises throughout the year!
"I lately took my friend Boswell and showed him genuine civilised life in an English provincial town.
I turned him loose at Lichfield."
