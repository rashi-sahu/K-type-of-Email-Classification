Project overview
The ARK project, a collaboration between
JISC, UKC
Library staff and the IS Learning and Research Systems Development team team, will analyse the impact of, and look at the potential gains from the University's implementation of the Raptor toolkit.
Raptor is a software suite, developed by Cardiff University, for the accounting of authentication information, primarily designed to assist institutions monitor e-resource usage.
Raptor reports will improve our understanding of the use of electronic resources, such as journals and databases by the staff and students of the University. Raptor reports will allow us to assess the usage of e-resources by each Academic school and use this data to identify patterns and levels of use across the University to help us better manage investment into electronic collections.
The ARK project will build on initial work carried out as part of the successful Raptor pilot programme at Kent in 2011. The project will convene and consult with stakeholders from E-resource and Academic Liaison, from our IT department and from Senior Management to give the team a comprehensive understanding of the value and uses of Raptor to improve work processes and inform strategic planning at Kent.
The reports, blogs and presentations which the project produces will contribute to a greater understanding of the way we use e-resources and how Raptor can help us to plan for and support future e-resource collections. Beyond the university, the dissemination of our findings will benefit the wider JISC community.
