Microviews
Welcome to MicroViews! MicroViews is a plugin for the jQuery javascript library. It will provide your users with dynamic tooltips for your linked EPrints.
The library is hosted from this site so that if your users have visit another MicroViews enabled webpage then their browser will not have to download the code again, reducing the load time impact on your pages.
Additionally this means that you will also always have the most recent and up to date version of MicroViews running on your web page.
MicroViews is being developed at the University of Southampton as part of the OneShare project.
