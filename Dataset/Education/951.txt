OXCRI is a project to unify the delivery of information about
continuing professional development courses at Oxford using XCRI.
The University's Computing Services, Careers Service, and Department
of Continuing Education have created web services to share and
aggregate information in a neutral XML format about their extensive
program of courses for students and staff.
1. Aims and objectives
The project aim is dynamic production of Oxford CPD courses in XCRI
format. We have
Generated XCRI CAP from three different existing datasets
Aggregated the information locally via a skills portal
Reported on appropriateness of the schema for this type of data
Experimented with using XCRI for internal management of course data
A more detailed report is available in report.xml.
2. XCRI data feeds
The OUCS course feed is documented at
http://active.oucs.ox.ac.uk/oucs/courses/xcri/oxcap.phpThe Skills Portal feed is at
http://www.skillsportal.ox.ac.uk/oxcri/cap.phpThe Continuing Education feed is at
http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/oxcri/conted.xml
3. Software
In order to experiment with ‘business rules’, and to
use extra XML validators,
we have reimplemented the CAP schema natively in
RELAX NG, and enhanced it with Schematron rules to make the data
constraints even more precise. When used with an editor like oXygen
which can read documentation elements, helpful tooltips are
available for each element.
The relevant files are
RELAX NG XML syntax schemaRELAX NG XML compact syntax
schemaW3C syntax schema (converted from
above)NVDL schema, which additionally
validates any embedded XHTML; this also uses a
schema for Dublin Core
4. Project methodology
The three participating units joint developed PHP scripts and
templates to produce XCRI CAP from their existing database systems
storing course details. The XCRI CAP is delivered through
standard web servers as REST services.
