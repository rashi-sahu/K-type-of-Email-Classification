About the UK-OER Programme
JISC and the Higher Education Academy are collaborating on the Open Educational Resources programme. The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) has provided an initial £5.7 million of funding for 29 pilot projects (April 2009 to March 2010) which will explore how we can expand the open availability and use of free, high quality online educational content.
These resources showcase the high quality of UK higher education and our vision is that they will be used and reused globally. Such resources might include full courses, course materials, complete modules, videos, assessments, tests, simulations, worked examples or software. The programme will support universities and colleges in exploring intellectual property rights, cultural issues, technical requirements and data management issues.
Project Overview
Practising Open Education, as part of the JISC-Academy UK OER Programme,
is a twelve-month project being managed by the ADM-HEA Subject Centre with six
art, design and media departments in UK universities.
As part of the ‘Cascade’ funding strand the OER Phase 2 Project’s aim is
to build upon the experiences understandings, findings and supporting resources
of the pilot ADM-OER Pilot Project to the benefit of the wider range of project
partners, the subject network and wider HE community.
By engaging directly with departmental staff the project aims to
investigate understandings of OERs within the partner institutions in order to
assess and address motivations and barriers to their creation and use.
The project will seek to highlight the potential benefits of OERs with
regard to institutional and staff profiles. In consideration of enhancing the
student experience the project’s underlying message implies the long-term
merits of OER creation and use in raising pedagogic standards.
The project’s key strategy is to work with staff across the department
in order to shape and realise each partner’s ‘OER vision’. The project is
grounded in the belief that institutional support, staff understandings and
constructive dialogue across the department provide the best opportunity to
encourage cultural change. In order to work effectively in the online ecology
OERs provide an appropriate mechanism to fulfill this potential.
The project’s objective is to encourage
engagement with openly accessible teaching and learning resources providing
opportunities for widening participation in higher education. Through the
processes of the project partners will collate and create, making openly
accessible, and repurposable licensed resources available through institutional
portals and the Jorum Open website.
The findings, outputs, final report and additional reports are available on the:
ADM-OER Pilot Project Website
Project Methodology
Focus Groups
A focus
group will be held in each participating department comprising a range of
staff, from across all subject areas including: teaching, library services, IT
services, management (HoD) and, where possible, partner FE institutions,
performing arts staff and student representatives.
The focus
groups will be a mechanism to collect information about:
Perceptions
of art, design and media OERs; motivations for, and barriers to, their creation
and useRepository
facilities in placeTechnical

In addition there is a whole range of supporting documents, templates, reports and OER guidance information available at: ADM-OER Pilot Project Website
Departmental Action Plans
The
designated departmental ‘project leader’ has drawn upon the recommendations highlighted in the Focus Group Repopts and the Action Plan Feedback in
order to work with departmental staff to develop a strategic OER Action plan.
The departmental  Action Plan identifies actions which address barriers and
capitalise on motivations within the department for OER production and use and ultimately embed
effective OER practices and policies.
In
implementing their OER Action Plan, departments have been able to call on the
support of the Project Manager, access the resources developed as part of the
ADM-OER pilot project, and draw upon the support from the pilot project’s
Institutional Leaders, at University of the Arts, London, University for the
Creative Arts and University of Cumbria, who, if required, have been available as consultants
for the Phase 2 project.
See Support Documents above for 'Action Plan Feedback' Template

Community of Practice
"While institutions can coordinate open educational
resource projects, faculty who voluntarily share their creative works are the
primary force behind the success of these projects".
David Wiley  - On the Sustainability of
Open Educational Resource Initiatives in Higher Education
The project believes that pedagogic practice
is the central issue in OERs and that the opinions, perceptions and support
from the subject community is fundamental.
The processes, outcomes and findings of the
project are to be shared by all. The project values your input in this. Please
feel free to follow the course of the project and you are encouraged to comment
and get involved.

The project has now been completed the Final Report is available below:
Final Project Report (click to download)
To help support the subject and HE communities a briefer Summary Report is currently being drafted by the project management and will be made available through this website.
Although the funded project period has concluded many of the project partners' 'actions' and activities extend beyond this period as well as the continued release of resources through Jorum Open and other platforms.
For information regarding the continuing activities please read the ADM-HEA Bulletin updates and go to the Project Blog
Project Evaluation Report
In order to help assess the processes, outcomes and potential long-term impact the partners have shared their experiences, reflected on the lessons, challenges and successes of the project. These observations, together with identified strategies for sustainability and plans for further developing open educational practice, have been collated into a report, available here as a PDF download:

OER News
A special issue of JIME: Journal of Interactive Media
is now available online covering a range of important OER topics.
The articles are available to download as PDFs or in HTML format.

What Do You Know About Copyright?
The University College Falmouth is undertaking the Intellectual Property Rights For Educational Environments (IPR4EE) Project for the UK OER Programme Phase 2.As part of the project the team have designed a questionnaire to
assess how much we really know about copyright, trade marks and
patents. If you follow the link you can respond to show your knowledge
of these issues.
The questionnaire is not a test and there are no ‘right’ or ‘wrong’
responses but it is important we answer the questions honestly.
