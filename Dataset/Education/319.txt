JISC Course Data Project
Update
The Oxford Brookes University XCRI-CAP is now live and the data feed can be accessed from the following URI:

Summary
At Oxford
Brookes University we
recognise the increasing demand for course data in the UK education system and that access to course data has a
significant impact on student choice, domestically and internationally. As stated in
the report to HEFCE by the Online Learning Task Force January 2011: “Only with
better information can prospective students find what they want, judge value for money
and make more accurate decisions about where and how to study. Better information will
give institutions competitive edge".
It is for these reasons that we wish to participate in the JISC Course
Data project: Making the most of course information.
We will, during the course of the project, collate and publish course
data on all of its award-bearing provision, regardless of duration or mode of study, in
a consistent form to enable ease of access and comparison by both internal and external
users. This consistency of information and reduction of duplication will give students
access to higher quality information and enable the diversity of higher education to be
brought into a single source.
In undertaking this we will pay due regard to the KIS data and related
developments with a view to ensuring that these data items are also captured in a
consistent way and can be included in its core data set of course
information.
As part of this, we will develop protocols, standards and templates
which will use to extend this approach to non award-bearing courses in due
course.

Objectives
The objectives for the project as agreed by
Oxford Brookes University are:
To establish a standard data set for
course information
To apply this data set across the
University to existing and new courses
To refine its core systems in order to
establish a comprehensive central repository for all course data, subject to
appropriate quality assurance and controls
To enable, through use of a data mart,
the export and publication of course data from this central repository to a variety
of end users and other systems
To adopt XCRI-CAP as the means by which data is exported to specific
destinations
To fully evaluate the approach to
standardisation and publication of data in order to inform future policy and
practice.
