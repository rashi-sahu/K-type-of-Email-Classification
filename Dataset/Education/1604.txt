Used by thousands of people every month and recognised by the leading UK and Irish cultural institutions, the Conservation Register is the only source for finding approved professionally qualified conservator-restorers.
Run by the registered charity, the Institute of Conservation (Icon) for the benefit of the public, the Conservation Register provides up-to-date information on who to go to for advice and expertise on the repair, restoration and care of valuable objects ranging from paintings to pottery to historic interiors and monuments,
archaeology and archives to steam engines and sculpture.
Each practice selected for the Conservation Register completes a rigorous application process run by Icon and is led by a conservator-restorer who meets the standards required by their professional body.
If you are looking for a specialist to address issues with a heritage building (apart from elements of buildings, such as wallcoverings, stained glass, stone, brick and decorative and movable items), then you can access current links to relevant listings on the
The Institute of Historic Building Conservation’s Resources Page or you can visit the web registers directly, such as the RIBA Conservation Register or the IHBC's own register HESPR, or the Register of Architects Accredited in Building Conservation AABC.
Please note that not all Icon-accredited conservators are listed on the Conservation Register. Not all are in private practice and some are therefore unable to accept commissioned work from the public.
