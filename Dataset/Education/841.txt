Low Carbon ICT: Welcome
Welcome to the low-carbon ICT project
The low-carbon ICT project team developed tools and techniques to reduce the energy
consumed by desktop computers at the University of Oxford.
The 5-steps to green desktop
computing is designed to help groups to develop and share their experiences of
implementing green desktop computing initiatives.
Liverpool
University used the open source code developed during this project to (a)
offer a wake on LAN service across Liverpool (b) further develop the software with
the aim of offering wake on LAN as a
shared service
to any UK educational organisation.
