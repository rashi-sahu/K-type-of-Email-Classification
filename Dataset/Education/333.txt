Welcome to CURVE
The Coventry University Repository Virtual Environment is the bridge between the e-learning environment (CUOnline) and the information environment provided by the university’s Lanchester Library. It is being developed with the help of a JISC funded project under the Repositories Start-up and Enhancement Programme. CURVE will provide easy discoverability, management and access to a wide variety of digital assets including learning objects, some important archive material and research ouputs. However CURVE’s main purpose is to be a major element in the univesity’s technology enhanced learning environment. CURVE is based on the Equella repository system developed by The Learning Edge. The Blogroll links to the websites of our major partners: JISC, The Learning Edge, the Centre for Interprofessional e-Learning (CiPEL) and the Siobhan Davies Dance Online Project.
STOP PRESS!
CURVE has won through the UK and Ireland Regional Finals of the Learning Impact Awards and will now compete in the Global Finals in May 2009.
