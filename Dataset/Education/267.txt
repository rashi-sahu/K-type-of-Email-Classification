Copyright, licencing and all that jazz
Posted on August 5, 2011

This morning I met to discuss the finer details of copyright and Creative Commons licencing with Paul Williams, ILS Team Leader: Academic Services and Roger Fairman, Library Services Development Officer. The recent media activity has raised a lot of questions about copy and reproduction rights that we need to settle before www.worldofkays.org goes live.
In keeping with the spirit of the JISC funding strand, we intend to apply the following Creative Commons terms to all content on the website:
Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-S)
This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon the work non-commercially, as long as they credit University of Worcester and license their new creations under the identical terms.
We have drawn up WORLDOFKAYS_terms of use for contributors so that they agree to licence their contributions in this way, and to assign reproduction rights to the university.
Paul and I will be discussing these issues with Naomi Korn on Monday and hope that once they are resolved, we will be able to go live without concerns over the rights.
The website itself is coming along fast – we are just trying to amass content for the blogs and comments boxes to ensure that there is something for the first visitors to read.  As a result of the amazing publicity we have received over the last fortnight and the events we’ve attended, we have been gathering comments and anecdotes from all over Britain  (BBC Breakfast News! ITV Central 6 o’clock News! The Daily Mail!).
A letter arrived for the project team yesterday adressed to ‘Kays Catalogue Project/ Worcester University / Worcester’. Bless the Royal Mail, it found us and was even un-franked! It contained a wonderful letter from a lady in Telford who still uses the artificial Christmas Tree bought from Kays in the early 1960s and for which she was never invoiced.
The Facebook and Twitter feeds continue to be our main online presence and are serving to create a wonderful community focussed on Kays, its history and style.  The age range of online contributors is satisfyingly broad, challenging some preconceptions that a web-based project might exclude older contributors.
My new spindrier
Our community outreach freelancer, Suze Carter, has been hard at work interviewing former Kays staff this week, collecting some glorious reminiscence material.  We have been approached by former buyers, marketing and PR officers and photographers, as well as staff from the adminstrative offices and warehouses.
We are slowly gaining a powerful insight into how Kays developed and presented its images as well as receiving a commentary on how ‘true to life’ some of the imagery actually was. We heard this week from women who really did do the housework in frilly pinnies and an ‘up-do’; and who delighted in the arrival of such labour-saving devices as this 1960 spindrier.  Once again, we realise how lucky we are to be born now!

…our new addition to the team.  Dr Suzanne Carter joined us on 19 July to provide freelance support with our community engagment programme.
Suzanne comes to us from English Heritage where she was Regional Outreach Manager for eight years.  She has worked on all manner of community arts and heritage projects including the award winning Corner Shop.  Currently we are sharing her with a group in Brierley Hill!
Suzanne will be carrying out the oral history interviews from which we hope to gain some juicy web content and sound clips.  She has loads of brilliant ideas about how we might structure our outreach programme and will be a real asset to our team.

Coffee & Kays a great success

Over 50 members of the local community dropped in to join the World of Kays team in the Peirson Library and reminisce about the lifestyles promoted by the Kays catalogues.
Many visitors were former Kays staff members, one of whom had travelled from Warrington to attend the event.
Former Kays buyers recalled working with celebrity models such as Anita Harris and Lorraine Chase, whilst other visitors brought in photographs of Kays pantomimes and staff newsletters from the 1960s and 1970s.
World of Kays staff were kept busy searching for catalogue pictures of prized outfits bought by visitors over the years. One lady recalled the day in the 1980s that four telephonists turned up to work at Kays each wearing the same polka dot dress!
Also present to provide the historical background to the company was Bernard Mills, Chair of Kays Heritage Group. Mr Mills was responsible for rescuing the Kays business archive and has ensured its long term future by depositing it in the Research Collections at the University.
Mr Mills said ‘I am delighted with the response that the university has had from the public in making this material more widely available through this project and look forward to future events’.
Clare Bridge and Jo Waterhouse from Second Hand Rose in the Hopmarket added extra colour by bringing a stall of vintage clothing which visitors browsed during the day.
Ms Bridge said ‘the catalogues really are a special collection and very inspiring for vintage nuts like us!’
Jenni Waugh, World of Kays project manager said ‘The event went brilliantly. We were looking for stories of the lifestyles and fashions marketed by Kays and the visitors today certainly gave us all that and more!’
The next World of Kays appearance will be on 30 July at the Worcester Community Games when the team will host a display of 20th century sportswear in the King George V Community Centre.

All are invited to our first Coffee & Kays event on 20 July 2011
We are all tremendously busy putting together displays and amusements for our first community event on 20 July 2011.It’s based at the university becasue we realised that there are a large number of staff who have connections to Kays, having worked there themselves or in associated businesses.  It is also being advertised to city residents through the press, fliers, our social media links and partners’ blogs.  You can read the press release here: PRESS_Coffee & Kays event 12-07-11
The atmosphere on campus is very ‘end of term’-ish as all the students have gone and things are much quieter.  So we thought we’d theme the event like a 1970s/80s party with a quiz, birght decorations and lots of party biscuits (pink wafers, jammy dogers etc).
Clare from Second Hand Rose, one of the Vintage Clothes shops in town is bringing a stall and we have found a member of the ILS tech-support team who collects electornic toys.  He’s managed to make a 1982 Atari console talk to a 2010 digital flatscreen TV so we can all play Pacman and Asteroids.  Superb!
Janet, Debbie and I are busily preparing displays along the themes of body image and sport & leisure.  Debbie has also prepared a prize quiz to get people guessing about the dates of the fashion shoots. These will all double nicely for our display at the Community Games at King George V recreation ground on 30 July.

Social Media, What Shall We Do Next?

The Project Team was represented at this event at Wolverhampton Archives on June 29th. The session was led by Nick Booth and Gavin Wray from Podnosh. It was great  to find out how museums and cultural organisations are using social media. There were some very interesting discussions about using social media on a local, regional and global basis. We hope to be able to incorporate some of these ideas  as we continue to promote World of Kays.  A report of the event has been posted on Museum Musings: http://westmidlandsmdo.wordpress.com/2011/06/30/social-media-what-shall-we-do-next/

Selecting the images

Cover for 1956 spring/summer collection
The selection process is underway and going well.  After consultation with Barbara Mitra, Senior Lecturer in Media and Cultural Studies, and Emma Bartlett, Wardrobe Supervisor for First Family Entertainment, we have settled upon a set of criteria which will encompass a wide variety of lifestyle and body image choices for men, women and children. The full criteria is published with the other project documents.
The audience for Kays catalogue were predominantly what we would now term C2DE: lower middle & working class people who would not otherwise be able to access credit or afford to purchase the items outright.  The weekly payments system meant items could be bought ‘on tick’ and paid for over time.
Until the 1970s, much emphasis is placed on the ‘reliability’ and ‘durability’ of the clothing for sale.  People’s wardrobes appear to be smaller and the cost of clothing makes every piece an investment. To this end, ‘high-fashion’ items are fewer than in later years – an outfit might have to last several seasons.
We will take images from 3 years in each decade: the first  (eg 1930), the 3rd and the 7th year.  To dip in once every 10 years was too great a gap, as was to dip in every five.  This way, we are able to show any major shifts in aspiration or image, whilst also emphasising what remains the same.

First post – how exciting!

This is the blog for the Cataloguing Kays project team.  We plan to use it as a team diary to record our progress: what we have learned, the big decisions we have to make and who we work with as we go.
The project is funded by JISC and being delivered by Jenni Waugh, Janet Davidson and Debbie Offen. Supporting us are a number of people from the University of Worcester including Dr Rachel Johnson, Research Librarian: Andrew Rothery, Senior Fellow in E-Learning; and Catriona Smellie, project manager for Museum@WRI. Tim Johnson, Digital Literacy Advisor, is our web 2.0-enabled Fairy Godmother.
Over the next couple of months, we’ll be working closely with web designers, Field of Vision, and the two Johns, the digitisation wizards from Worcestershire Record Office, to create a website and digital archive of images from the Kays Catalogues.
We’re currently selecting the images for the website and discussing how we might present them so that they can best be accessed by both the most skilled researcher and the first-time browser. We want everyone visiting the site to feel they too can contribute their favourite fashion moments, comment on the styles on display or tell us how Kays of Worcester affected their own lives.
I’m really looking forward to making this project a part of the fabric of Worcester life.
