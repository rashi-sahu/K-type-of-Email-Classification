Community Café Project
The project will address a particular problem: the scarcity of up-to-date, online resources for community languages. The aim of the project is to work together to co-create a community collection of online language and cultural materials which will significantly enhance existing materials to support community languages.
Timescale
May, 2010 - March, 2011
Key contact(s):
Kate Borthwick, project manager, LLAS.Funded by:
The Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC)Project partners:
Southampton City Council; the COLT Project, Manchester Metropolitan
University
Project aims:
To use expertise and tools developed at the University of Southampton to collect and co-create
digital resources for community languages
To build a self-managed community-based group to support
community language speakers engaged in teaching and learning the range of
community languages available locally
To improve the pedagogy of existing materials through
peer review and discussion
To provide bespoke and incremental training in using and
creating digital content
To contribute to the enhancement of the profile and
provision of community language learning through adding resources to a
repository hosting a wide range of existing language resources
Outcomes:
The following areas
of impact are anticipated:
Collection and enhancement of available
materials for and in community languages, accessible to all sectors of society
through the community repository;
Raising the status of community languages
both locally and nationally;
Up-skilling of community language
speakers who engage in ‘out of hours’ teaching both through engagement with
e-learning and through greater consideration of their pedagogic practice;
Support for local bodies working with
community languages and professional development providers through the
availability of the 'workshops to go'
Transferring knowledge, expertise and
practice in HE to other sectors;
Increased engagement by the University of Southampton with the local community
(the Language Café Project has already raised local interest and been featured
on local radio). The University is not necessarily viewed as accessible by all
sectors of the local community – this project provides access in a
non-threatening, socially inclusive way;
Creation of regional collaboration in
community languages support with the potential for extension across the UK;
Community support which will raise the
profile of the University
of Southampton locally
and nationally, as well as making a real contribution to a very poorly-served
sociolinguistic group
The JISC Community Content Programme
This project is part of the JISC’s Developing Community Content programme. The programme has funded ten projects at UK universities to create and use digital content that is useful not only for those involved in Higher Education, but also for various communities within the broader general public.
