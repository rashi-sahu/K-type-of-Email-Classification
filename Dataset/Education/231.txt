The CORE-SET project will release, collect and further publish OERs in the area of science, engineering and technology, working in partnership with public, private and 3rd sector organisations. Using other sources of open materials, the project will look into creating themed collections that target the Science, Engineering, Technology (SET) community and are relevant both to the partners and HE in general.
