OVAM
The Online Veterinary Anatomy Museum (OVAM) project was initially funded by Jisc as part of the Content Programme 2011-2013. It aims to provide access to veterinary anatomical resources in the form of a virtual museum. The museum was launched on 20th November 2012. It is now live at www.onlineveterinaryanatomy.net.
OVAM provides access to a comprehensive and pedagogically structured set of veterinary anatomical resources. These are aggregated and ordered in an environment which makes them easily discoverable by different cohorts of learners. Key to the success of this project will be the development of effective methodologies to embed and integrate these materials within a traditional curriculum to maximise exposure, uptake and sustainability.
This project was funded by the Jisc Content Programme for 2011-13.Jisc inspires UK colleges and universities in the innovative use of digital technologies, helping to maintain the UK's position as a leader in education and research.
