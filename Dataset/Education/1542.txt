BBC News Archive - Matthew Somerville

BBC News Archive
As well as the home page archive,
I try and maintain an archive of the BBC News front page,
which can be used to generate some interesting data.
Welcome to the Tardis.
Disclaimer: As these are just prototypes, some of these require JavaScript to work
properly and aren't guaranteed to work in everything (though I hope they do).
Tag Clouds
An interesting way of summarising the BBC headlines.
Main headline, time weighted
Main headline, not time weighted
All headlines, not time weighted
History of individual stories
A timeline, both visual and textual, for each unique story
mentioned on the front page. For example, the history of
#4771586,
Crash lands shock Oscar triumph.
This is interlinked from the other prototypes.
Searches
Image Search
This prototype searches the headline text and alternate text of photos used to illustrate
stories on the front page of BBC News, and displays the photos that match:
(e.g.
Clarke)

Headline Search
This prototype searches the headline text for
stories on the front page of BBC News:
(e.g. Iran)
Search
This general search prototype looks through the headline text and accompanying text for
stories on the front page of BBC News, linking through to the
timeline prototype.
(e.g. Clinton)
Categories
An improved version of a current prototype, showing the
distribution over time by category of headlines.
Image timeline
Displaying all the pictures used to illustrate front page stories,
the image timeline provides a
visual overview of a month's news. This page is large, and can be
slow to load.
Story timelines
Any combination of stories can be plotted on a visual timeline.
The system also lets you store one you've created (by using the
search) with a title for ease of access; for example, the
timeline of Big Brother 2007.
Metadata
The following dates are missing from my archive
and prototypes, due to various problems such as server failures:
2005
1st–3rd, 5th–7th, 30th November; 6th–31st December
2006
26th January, 4th–5th September, 25th–31st October,
13th–18th and 27th–30th November, 11th–21st December
The following dates are missing from the archive,
but are still in the prototypes, as the summary files
were made before I lost the archived archive:
