Welcome to Britain’s National Fencing Museum, which traces the
history of the sport of fencing over 450 years. The museum houses a
library of over 300 books, 250 paintings and prints, 200 weapons,
numerous masks, kit, trophies, posters, programmes, medals, stamps,
postcards and other ephemera. It provides a glimpse into the past: to a
time when the art of fencing was an elegant accomplishment, an essential
part of a gentleman’s education and beyond to the days when a
knowledge of the science of defence could mean the difference between
life and death.
