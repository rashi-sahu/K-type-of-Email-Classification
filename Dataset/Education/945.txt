The “OpenMentor Technology Transfer” (OMtetra) project addresses the JISC call in appropriately exploiting technology-enhanced assessment and feedback to enable more authentic and more useful feedback on assignment performance, thus improving assessment quality, enhancing the student experience, and supporting staff.  It will do this by packaging the JISC-funded OpenMentor technology innovation of the Open University and supporting its transfer to two external institutions – University of Southampton and King’s College London – where it will be developed to address their identified needs to improve student feedback.
The potential impact of the OMtetra project is profound.  There is currently no tool with the simple yet compelling “value proposition” of OpenMentor:  to take a set of marked assignments, profile the feedback provided, and support the tutor in reflecting upon and improving that feedback.
The project will embed sustainability in a community of users, seeded at the originating institutions and reaching out to all interested practitioners both in the UK and world-wide, providing community access and tools to ensure the continued development and use of OpenMentor.
