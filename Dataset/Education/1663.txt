Situated at picturesque Newry Beach, the museum is a fascinating family experience. Take a step back in time at the oldest lifeboat station in Wales.
Learn about shipwrecks, gallant rescues and pirates. Find out what it was like to sail on the Irish Sea 100 years ago. Visit our WW2 Air Raid Shelter and marvel at our collection of WW1 and WW2 memorabilia. You can even test out our authentic Air Raid Siren!
