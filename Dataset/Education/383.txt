VMAP Visual Mapping of Portfolios
VMAP Visual Mapping of Portfolios
About the VMAP Project
Round 2 Developments
The VMAP Project has received further funding to develop the software, carry
out pilot implementations and user trials. The funding from round 2 of the
Distributed
elearning Programme covers developments from June 2005 to March 2006.
Round 1 Developments
The VMAP project was initially funded by JISC under round
1 of the Distributed
elearning Programme, from September 2004 - March 2005. The purpose
of the VMAP project was to develop
an elearning tool that would enable the development
of ePortfolios. The particular approach that the project team adopted was
to allow the development (and display) of a portfolio using a visual map
to allow
the representation of the portfolio. Further details from the VMAP
project page on the JISC website.
Project documentation available from the Project Development pages held within the E-learning framework website.
About the VMAP Software
Software
The broad aim
is to provide a software tool that will be more
accessible to dyslexics and better enable them to produce an e-Portfolio than
existing tools.
The objectives of the project are to:
Enable the learner to interact with a pre-defined institutional template
for preparing e Portfolios in a format that is most accessible to the learner;
Enable the learner to plan, construct and update an e Portfolio through
the use of a visual mapping interface, on their own personal desktop;
Enable the learner to share, publish and disseminate an e Portfolio through
the use of a visual mapping interface, to their institutional system.
Getting the Software
The software is written in Java using Java 1.4.2+, so should run on all operating
systems. You can download versions of VMAP from our files
page on sourceforge, or run the latest
version using Java Web start. If you are
more adventurous and would like to download the project from the sourceforge
code repository using cvs, then you can from our cvs
pages.
License
The software is released under the GNU General Public License.
Using ePortfolios
Exemplars of using e Portfolios will be added here as they are developed.
