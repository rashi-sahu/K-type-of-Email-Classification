Welcome to the Florence Nightingale Museum
The Florence Nightingale Museum celebrates the life and work of the world’s most famous nurse. Located on the banks of the river Thames opposite the Houses of Parliament, the museum attracts visitors from all over the world who want to learn more about the Lady with the Lamp and her Victorian world. We also examine Florence’s legacy, her influence on nursing today and the continuing relevance of her work. The Florence Nightingale Museum runs a busy learning programme for schools and families activities, as well as a lively events programme with regular afternoon and event talks. Please check our What’s On page for more information.
