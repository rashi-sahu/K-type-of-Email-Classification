The Ure Museum houses one of the largest
collections of Greek ceramics in Britain
Discover more about Greek mythology and life
through images on our many vases. Find out how Odysseus escaped
the Cyclops cave or study scenes of warriors going into
battle.
See everyday and extraordinary objects, from the
small oil bottles that athletes wore around their wrists to a mask
of the terrifying Gorgon Medusa.
Learn about the Egyptians too, through our
important and exciting collection of artefacts, including a
fascinating funerary boat, jewellery, grave offerings and a
mummified cat's head.
