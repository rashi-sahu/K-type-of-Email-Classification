Promoting Student Web 2.0 Contributions with Lightweight Enterprise RSS
TWOLER [two-ler] is investigating the climate under which the open, collaborative and participatory environment found on the “Web 2.0” can be used to achieve university goals.
Student interest in Web 2.0 and consumer technology (e.g. YouTube, Facebook) is a given, what we are exploring is where and how this interest, energy and imagination can deliver elements of value to the university. TWOLER relies on the newly introduced Google Apps environment at Westminster which provides the technology, tools and access for student contributions.
The project comprises two substantial activities:
an exploration of the extent of valuable student contributions in a web 2.0 environment and
the development and enabling of the 'brownfield' university infrastructure.
Come and explore  with us ways of making the university applications (e.g. Black Board, Library and your student record) more accessible in the Web2.0 world. If you have an idea that  would make a difference for student life at Westminster -  cool, innovative or just plain useful -  we would love to hear from you.
There are a number of ways for students (& staff) to join the project:
Paid Summer Studentships
Gadgets & Mashups Competition
Mixing & Mashing Day
Submit an idea for development
