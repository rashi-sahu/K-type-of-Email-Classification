Introduction
Welcome to the RELOAD web site. Things are changing. The web-site is undergoing an overhaul and a clean-up. If you wish to access the old web-site you can do so here. In the meantime we have provided the important links to the RELOAD tools
below.
Background
What is RELOAD?
RELOAD is a project funded under the JISC Exchange for Learning Programme (X4L).
The project focuses on the development of tools that are based on
emerging learning technology interoperability specifications. It is
managed by the University of Bolton with staff located at the University of Bolton and the University of Strathclyde.
The primary aims of this project are to:
facilitate the creation, sharing and reuse of learning objects and services
enhance the range of pedagogical approaches realisable through the use of lesson plans
These aims will be achieved through the production of a suite of
software tools for authoring and delivery of standard-compliant
learning objects incorporating comprehensive user guides and exemplar
resources. The tools will be of significant value to the JISC and wider
community, since they provide the crucial "missing link" which allows
users to author and transfer learning objects, in specification
compliant format, between authoring and design tools, local and
distributed digital repositories, and VLEs.
Tools & Downloads
The following are the tools created by the RELOAD project:
