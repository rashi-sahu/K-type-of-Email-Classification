Next Generation Embryology goes live
21 September 2010 - 4:02pm — Jano.van.Hemert
NG Embryo aims to create an educational repository of developmental biology models that is:
- Accessible to researchers, teachers and students
- Searchable via annotated images rather than keywords and free text
- Able to map results onto 3D models of developing embryos
- Updated and enhanced with materials from researchers and lecturers throughout the world
- Free and available online

Publicity flyer for Next Generation Embryology
4 May 2010 - 1:01pm — Jano.van.Hemert
The Next Generation Embryology project is funded by JISC (Joint Information Systems Committee), a sponsor that supports education and research by promoting innovation in new technologies. The attached PDF flyer provides a brief introduction to the main aims of the project.Topic of this submission: NewsResearch topics: Collaborative environmentsIntuitive interfacesProjects: NextGenerationEmbryology

Next Generation Embryology: Using 3D embryo atlas frameworks for research and education
4 May 2010 - 12:53pm — Jano.van.Hemert
Speaker(s): Gagarine.YaikhomPresentation Type: talk3D developmental atlases are used in research for capture, collation and analysis of spatio‐ temporal data such as in situ gene‐expression. The most advanced systems are based on a temporal series of 3D models. Examples are the EADHB human embryo atlas in Newcastle and the e‐MouseAtlas in Edinburgh. In this project, we use the 3D spatio‐temporal frameworks in conjunction with a repository to deliver research and educational materials directly in the context of the developing embryo.Date and time: Tuesday, 11 May, 2010 - 13:20Location: The Influence and Impact of Web 2.0 on Various Applications, e-Science Institute, Edinburgh, UKWeb site: http://www.nesc.ac.uk/esi/events/1078/Research topics: Collaborative environmentsIntuitive interfacesProjects: NextGenerationEmbryology

Screencast: annotating embryo models on-line in a web browser
9 February 2010 - 3:00pm — Jano.van.Hemert
Screencast of a prototype for the JISC-funded project "Next Generation Embryology" where biologists can annotate 3D objects that represent models of mouse and human embryos with arbitrary bits of information held in a DSpace repository. Here we show what the interface looks like.

Next Generation Embryology
6 July 2009 - 10:33am — Jano.van.Hemert
Speaker(s): Jano.van.HemertPresentation Type: talkWe introduce the Next Generation Embryology project: Next Generation in two ways. First, because its aim is to revolutionise the way the next generation of developmental biologists are educated. Where instead of relying on plastic models and diagrams in books, the idea is to use a digital library that is indexed using virtual 3D models of mouse and human embryos.Date and time: Wednesday, 8 July, 2009 - 09:00Location: JISC Information Environment and Virtual Research Environment projects start-up meeting, Leicester, UKWeb site: http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/inf11/inf11startup.aspxJISC: JISC#INF11Projects: NextGenerationEmbryology
