LEaD: Learner Experiences across the Disciplines
The LEaD project recorded the student year through
students' own voices. It captured the "critical moments";
students' expectations and experiences of using technology as they
make the transition to university, and how this changes as they
progress through their first year.
The key questions addressed during the project were:
What are students' expectations regarding learning technologies?
How do students adapt their approaches to e-learning over their first
year at university?
What are the key factors that influence students' e-learning
strategies?
To what extent do students use personal technologies to
support their learning?
For more information on the project, please follow the links on the left.
LEaD was part-funded by JISC and ran from March 2007 to September 2008.
Watch some of the project team in the video clip Responding to
Learners, a resource to support the JISC publication Effective
Practice in a Digital Age (June 2009).
