Project OverviewLIPID BLOGLIPID ResourcesProject Overview
The LIPID project is being funded by JISC to demonstrate the use of the Sweet.Net toolkit which is part of the eLearning Framework (ELF). Our use will be to transfer data between the SITS student management system and the PebblePad ePortfolio system. The aim of the project is to allow students to draw upon institutionally held data such as grades or contact information which will then appear in their personal area within PebblePad. Students will then be able to use this information to support further progression or job application. The project brings together The University of Wolverhampton Centre for Excellence in Learning and Teaching and Registry departments, Queen Margaret University College in Edinburgh and Pebble Learning The University of Wolverhampton and Pebble Learning will be developing the links to the toolkit and getting the systems to interoperate. Once this work is complete Queen Margaret University College will be implementing the solution to ensure the portability of the work to other organisations. The project runs from March 1st to August 31 2006.
