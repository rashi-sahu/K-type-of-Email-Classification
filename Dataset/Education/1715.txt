Fatal Accident at work in a Museum
Leave a reply
When we go to work, we expect to be safe from harm; however, if our employers or the owner of the workplace fails to take the necessary precautions then people can be put at risk. If you work in a museum, it is essential that steps are taken to minimise the risks to all employees. If you have been hurt in an accident whilst working in museum, then you may be eligible to make a claim for compensation.
The Dangers of Working in a Museum
There are lots of dangers associated with working in a museum, but one of the primary dangers comes from slips, trips and falls. Museums are often set out in quirky and unusual ways to attempt to appeal to visitors, however this can be dangerous for museum workers. If the design of the museum puts workers at risk from slipping, tripping or falling, then the museum owner could be held responsible for any injuries. Workers in museums with interactive displays must pay particular attention to slip, trip and fall hazards because visitors could drop or spill things on the floor. Anything that is dropped onto the floor should be cleared up straight away.
Museum workers should also pay particular attention if they are asked to move display items. Some display items, such as dinosaur bones, can be quite heavy. Incorrect lifting techniques can result in ongoing back injuries. Dropping heavy items can also lead to crushing injuries and broken bones.
Some museum workers are required to use heavy machinery or technical equipment as part of their role. Heavy machinery and technical equipment always carries a risk factor with it. Possible injuries include; crushing, blinding, deafening and electrocution. Employers are responsible for taking steps to minimise these risks. Any machinery which is used by museum staff must also be properly maintained and serviced according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. In 2014, an external equipment supplier was found to be partially at fault for the death of museum worker, Michael Buckingham, after they supplied faulty equipment for a job. Mr Buckingham became trapped between two pieces of faulty machinery and was unable to be freed due to major failings.
Depending on the type of museum, employees also run the risk of being exposed to harmful substances as part of their job. For example, some museums involve displays using chemical substances. If you are asked to handle harmful substances as part of your role as a museum work, you should be provided with appropriate personal protective equipment. Even working in a dusty environment for prolonged periods of time can put workers at risk of developing chronic lung problems.
What to do if you have been injured in a accident at work or if you were working in a museum
If you have been injured whilst working in a museum, you may be eligible to make a claim for compensation. If you are able to prove that you were not 100% at fault for the accident then you may have a valid case. Even if it can be shown that you were partially at fault for the incident, you can still try to lodge a claim. If you want to find out how much compensation for a accident at work claim you can claim for visit the link.
One of the most important things to remember if you are thinking about making a claim is that there are limitations on the timeframe for the claim. It is always best to launch your claim as soon as possible after the injury, because it is easier to collect evidence if you move swiftly.
Although you can launch a claim without professional support, you can also raise a claim with the support of a solicitor or claims advisor. If you speak to a solicitor or claims advisor they will be able to offer you professional guidance about the strength of your case. By listening to your story, they should be able to advise you about the potential value of your claim.
The potential value of your claim will normally take into account; the injuries that you suffered as a result of your accident; any pain and suffering associated with the accident; any loss of current or future income because of the accident; additional transportation costs; legal fees and any medical expenses that you have incurred because of the incident.
Once you have gathered evidence to support your claim, your solicitor or claims advisor will contact the defendant to notify them of the claim. If the defendant agrees with your claim, they may offer you the full amount. However, they may also make a counteroffer. If you cannot reach a settlement, the compensation claim may go to court. If the claim goes to court, it is possible that the judge may rule that you are not eligible for any compensation.
All museum staff should be fully trained to HSE standards
It is the responsibility of every employer to make sure that all staff members have been trained in the correct HSE standards and museum workers are no exception. A responsible employer should do a risk assessment for each role to ensure that they minimize the risks to that employee. Appropriate Health and Safety training should then be given based on the risks which have been identified. Employees must not be asked to do anything that falls outside of their current level of HSE training. For example, an employee should not be asked to use any heavy machinery which they have not been trained to use. HSE training for museum employees may include; VCU use; heavy lifting training; correct use of personal protective equipment; and training on the use of individual pieces of heavy machinery. You should speak to your employer immediately if you do not feel as though you have been given the correct training for your job role.
An employer may be considered to be negligent if an employee is injured because they have not been fully trained to HSE standards. If negligence is shown in a compensation case, the employer’s insurance provider may not be willing to pay out and the employer may have to cover the cost of the claim.
