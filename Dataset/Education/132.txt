ALT
Learning technology is the broad range of communication, information and related technologies that can be used to support learning, teaching, and assessment.
Established in 1993, ALT is the UK's leading membership organisation in the learning technology field.
Our purpose is to ensure that use of learning technology is effective and efficient, informed by research and practice, and grounded in an understanding of the underlying technologies, their capabilities and the situations into which they are placed.
We do this by improving practice, promoting research, and influencing policy.
