Developing an On-line Tool for Discovering Geo-Data and
Related Resources
Go-Geo! is a one year JISC-funded project
between EDINA (Data Library, University of Edinburgh)
and the UK Data Archive (University of Essex). The portal
will allow for the discovery of geographic data and
related resources within and beyond the HE and FE community.
A trial Go-Geo! Service
has now be launched for academic users and can be
accessed at http://www.gogeo.ac.uk/.
We are keen to receive feedback on the trial service
and invite users to complete the evaluation questionnaire
which is available from the site.
A series of
metadata
workshops are now being held at universities
across the UK. To find out if one is going to be held
near you, check out the metadata
workshop page.
