Database of Archives of Non-Governmental Organisations

The Database of Archives of Non-Government Organisations (DANGO)
was a project funded by the AHRC and then the Leverhulme Trust.
It provides information on the availability of records relating
to non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and pressure groups active in
the UK since 1945. The project ran until October 2011. Since
then, the database has not been updated and some links may no
longer work.
DANGO was run through the
Birmingham Centre
for Modern and Contemporary History at the University of Birmingham,
which also oversaw the sister project,
NGOs in Britain.
