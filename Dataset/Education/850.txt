About
the Project
Aims
of the project:
The broad aim of the project is to kick-start a critical
mass of METS-based projects within the UK so ensuring that UK
institutions are fully standards-based in their digital object
management.
Specifically it aims to:
• Raise general awareness of METS and other closely related
emerging standards both within the Programme, and amongst the
wider community served by JISC.
• Provide institutions with sufficient information to assess
how METS (and related standards) might contribute to their institution’s
current and planned digital preservation and asset management
activities.
• Enable them to find out more about METS for themselves, and
to prepare them for the two-day METS tutorial workshops which
the METS Editorial Board will be running.
Methodology:
The overall methodology will be a series of seminars
to be held at six locations around the UK. They will be designed
to introduce attendees to METS and to explore ways in which
it might benefit their current or future digitization projects.
In addition, existing training materials on METS at Oxford will
be developed further and made available to the broad library
community.
Outcomes:
• An accessible and adaptable set of training materials,
to raise awareness of the METS standard and its applicability
in the fields of institutional digital preservation and asset
management.
• A freely accessible website, making the current version of
the training materials available for download and reuse by others.
• A series of 6 training events, delivered at institutions around
the UK, presenting the training materials and providing ample
opportunity for attendees to engage with an expert in the METS
standard.
• Greater awareness of the METS standard within the communities
served by the JISC.
• A deeper understanding of the METS standard and its relevance
amongst those who access the training materials and, in particular,
those who attend the training events.
Timescale:
The project will run for two years, until October 2006.
Further updates on the project will appear here.
