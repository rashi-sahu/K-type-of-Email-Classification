Steeple: Welcome to the JISC Steeple project
Welcome to Steeple
Steeple is a JISC funded UK Higher Education community
project, led by Oxford University, the Open University, and Cambridge
University. We are hoping that many other UK Higher Education
Institutions will join in with the project.
The vision for the Steeple project is to investigate,
develop and document sustainable institutional infrastructure to support university wide educational podcasting. Steeple also hopes to instigate a viable community around scalable, enterprise-level solutions suitable for the UK-HE sector in the areas of automated video/audio
capture, video/audio processing, and video/audio delivery ("podcasting").
The vast majority of our work and outputs can be found in our community wiki, where knowledge and experience is constantly being updated.
The projects main concerns are:
Reducing costs for media processing and
media management
Making it easier to deliver media into channels important to the institution, such as iTunesU and the web portal
Supporting and documenting adoption of best practice for sustainability of the architecture and to ensure longevity of institutional investments
Steeple will look at:
Scoping, requirements, use cases
Policies, processes, workflows
Requirements for public access to video/audio
Private access to video/audio via LMS or VLE
Encoding engines
Service management
Training and support
Evaluation and dissemination
The Steeple development work falls primarily into four areas
Integration of the encoding engines and creation of encoding workflows
Further development work to an online database to monitor and track processes
Creation of a demonstrator web based delivery system for institutional podcasts
Documenting of activities
