Armagh County Museum
The oldest county museum in Ireland is set in Armagh’s beautiful Georgian tree lined Mall. Located near the centre of St Patrick’s cathedral city, a visit to Armagh County Museum is a ideal way to experience a flavour of the orchard county.
The unique character of the Museum’s architecture makes it one of the most distinctive buildings in the city.  Its collections capture centuries of stories relating to the people who lived, worked and had connections with this famous city and historic county.
Discover a rich and varied legacy revealed in objects ranging from prehistoric artefacts to household items from a bygone age.  There are military uniforms, wedding dresses, ceramics, natural history specimens and railway memorabilia. An impressive art collection includes works by many well known Irish artists such as AE Russell, John Luke and JB Vallely.
The Museum staff aim to ensure that all visitors feel welcome and are keen to help with enquiries.  There is an extensive reference library, rich in local archive material, along with photographic and map collections. With a range of changing exhibitions throughout the year, the Museum is an ideal place to begin and explore the fair county of Armagh.
