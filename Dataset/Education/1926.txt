Distributed eLearning regional pilots
Project Description
This project will establish a national demonstration model of cross-sector collaboration in
personal development planning technology to support widening participation. Phase 1 was funded by JISC from January 2005 to March 2006 (see draft final report ): Phase 2 funding has been granted and the project will now run until December 2006.
Aims
To support progression to HE for Widening Participation by making all major
existing electronic systems in use in the Nottingham area for study-based Progress
Files interoperable, using the UKLeaP interoperability standards
To pilot the transfer of data directly from the main post-16 PDP system (City of
Nottingham Passport) into HE PDP systems at the University of Nottingham and Nottingham
Trent University (NTU) to support learner admissions and transitions
To develop understanding of further transition processes between study and
employment (in both directions) and consider connections with issues of graduate
retention in the region
To contribute to the building of interoperability specifications for systems
supporting Lifelong Learning by providing further development of the UKLeaP open
standards and proving their applicability in a number of different environments
The project has also been an early adopter of Shibboleth: work on this has been led by the technical team at NTU (see report ).
