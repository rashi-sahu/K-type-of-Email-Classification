KRDS/I2S2 Digital Preservation Benefit
Analysis Tools Project
Introduction
This web page has been set-up to support
dissemination of information on the âKRDS/I2S2 Digital Preservation Benefit
Analysis Toolsâ Project. The project was funded between February-July 2011 as part of the
Preservation tools strand of the JISC 15/10 programme.
The project Â aimed to test, review and
promote combined use of the Keeping Research Data Safe (KRDS) Benefits
Framework and the I2S2 Value Chain Analysis tools for assessing the
benefits of digital
preservation of research data. It extended their utility to and adoption
within the JISC community by providing user review and guidance for the
tools
and creating an integrated toolset. The project consortium consisted of a
mix of
user institutions, projects, and disciplinary data services committed to
the
testing and exploitation of these tools and the lead partners in their
original
creation. We demonstrated and critiqued the tools, and then created and
disseminated the toolset and accompanying materials such as User Guides
and
Factsheets to the wider community.
Background
The Keeping Research Data Safe (KRDS) Benefits Framework tool was created as part of the KRDS projects funded by JISC.Â  KRDS
defined three dimensions and a framework to illuminate the broad outlines of the
benefits that digital preservation investments potentially generate. The KRDS
Benefits Framework is a high-level tool and it was recognised that users would
need to sharpen these generic expressions of preservation benefits into more
focused value propositions for specific cases.
The opportunity to do further work based on
KRDS was taken up by the Infrastructure
for Integration in Structural Sciences (I2S2) project funded by JISC under
the Research Data Management programme. A work package within I2S2 extended
the KRDS activity model (providing a more detailed view of activities within
research experiments in the KRDS pre-archive phase) and developed a more
detailed value-chain analysis for assessing benefits. It assigned benefits to
specific activities, and weighted their impact.Â  The tool was applied from two
different perspectives: one for a central service perspective; the other
looking at the researcher perspective.
Although only released in 2010, a number of
research data projects and services are already working with the KRDS2 cost
activity model and benefits framework and building up local experience and
adaptations. These include the SageCite and I2S2 projects at UKOLN, University
of Bath; the six population cohort case studies working with the MRC Data
Support Service; the Archaeology Data Service and the UK Data Archive. They
provide a number of knowledgeable research data services and projects who are
keen to feed-in their experience, explore and test new extensions to the
Toolset such as the I2S2 Value-Chain Analysis, and promote its future
dissemination.
The Project Team
The project partners were UKOLN and the Digital Curation Centre at the
University of Bath, the Centre for Health
Informatics and Multi-professional Education (CHIME) at University College
London , the UK Data Archive
(University of Essex), the Archaeology Data
Service (University of York),Â  OCLC
Research, andÂ  Charles Beagrie Limited.
Project Plan
Our project plan set out our programme of work and methodology and can be downloaded here.
Project WorkshopOur dissemination workshop was held on
Tuesday 12th July at 2011 South Bank University, Central London. ItÂ was a
very successful event with lively discussion on implementing the
toolkit with
funders and other attendees. AÂ full report of the dissemination workshop
and links to the presentationsÂ on the UKOLN site are now available.The KRDS Benefits Analysis ToolkitThe
Toolkit consists of two tools: the KRDS Benefits Framework (Tool 1);
and the Value-chain and Benefits Impact tool (Tool 2). Each tool
consists of a more detailed guide and worksheet(s). Both tools have
drawn on partner case studies and previous work on benefits and impact
for digital curation/preservation. This experience has provided a series
of common examples of generic benefits that are employed in both tools
for users to modify or add to as required.The KRDS Benefits
Framework (Tool 1) is the âentry-levelâ tool requiring less experience
and effort to implement and can be used as a stand-alone tool in many
tasks. It can also be the starting point and provide input to the use of
the Value-chain and Impact analysis.Â The Value-chain and
Benefits Impact analysis (Tool 2) is the most advanced tool in the
Toolkit and requires more experience and effort to implement. It is
likely to be most useful in a smaller sub-set of longer-term and
intensive activities such as evaluation and strategic planning.The
combined Toolkit provides a very flexible set of tools, worksheets, and
lists of examples of generic benefits and potential metrics. These are
available for you to use in different combinations appropriate to your
needs and level of expertise.Â Guides for the toolkit and each
individual tool and case studies of completed examples of the worksheets
provide documentation and support for your implementation.Toolkit GuideThis leaflet provides an introduction to the Toolkit and its components.Introduction to the KRDS Benefits Analysis Toolkit (PDF)The KRDS Benefits Framework Tool (Tool 1)The
Keeping Research Data Safe (KRDS) Benefits Framework is a tool for
identifying, assessing, and communicating the benefits from investing
resources in the curation/long-term preservation of research data.The
tool itself consists of a detailed guide and a worksheet.Guide to the KRDS Benefits Framework Tool (PDF)KRDS Benefits Framework Worksheet (Microsoft Word 97-2003) (Open Office Text)The Value Chain and Benefits Impact Tool (Tool 2)This
is the second and most advanced tool in the Toolkit. A detailed user
guide and two worksheets have been provided with the Tool: the Benefits
Impact worksheet and the Value-chain and Benefits Impact worksheet. To
use this Tool, you should first select which worksheet most closely
matches your needs. Both worksheets have been pre-populated with a
selection of common generic benefits also used in the Benefits Framework
Tool but you may review, delete or add more to the selection. The tool
has been designed to be generic but easily configurable by the user for
their specific needs or application.Guide to the Value Chain and Benefits Impact Tool (PDF)Benefits Impact Worksheet (Microsoft Excel 97-2003) (Open Office Spreadsheet)Value Chain and Benefits Impact Worksheet (Microsoft Excel 97-2003) (Open Office Spreadsheet)Worked Examples of Completed Worksheets from Project PartnersArchaeology: The background to this case study is provided in theÂ Archaeology Data Service (ADS) dissemination workshop presentation.
