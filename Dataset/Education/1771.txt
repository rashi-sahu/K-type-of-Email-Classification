NIPR, The National Collection of Northern Ireland Publications
Northern Ireland Charity Number: NIC102555.WHAT IS NIPR?
NIPR (formerly known as The Northern Ireland Publications Resource) is Northern Ireland’s National Collection of Northern Ireland Publications.
Northern Ireland has no National Library, so NIPR aims to identify, collect, preserve and make available for public consultation, every book, pamphlet, periodical and report published in Northern Ireland since January 2000.

Is é NIPR (ar a dtugtaí The Northern Ireland Publications Resource tráth) Bailiúchán Náisiúnta Thuaisceart Éireann d’Fhoilseacháin Thuaisceart Éireann.
Níl aon Leabharlann Náisiúnta ag Tuaisceart Éireann agus is aidhm le NIPR gach leabhar, paimfléad, iris agus tuairisc a foilsíodh i dTuaisceart Éireann ó bhí Eanáir 2000 ann a aimsiú, a bhailiú, a chaomhnú is a chur ar fáil le gur féidir leis an phobal amharc orthu.
