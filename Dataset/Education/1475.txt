eFEP team awarded University funding for follow-up scholarship project
Posted on September 13, 2014 by admin
As part of the New Models of Assessment and Tuition Project, María Fernández-Toro, Concha Furmboroug and Matilde Gallardo were awarded £860 internal funding by the Open University to run a small pilot study to evaluate the potential of ‘feedback on feedback’ (F on F) as a means of improving student engagement with their tutor-marked assignments at the Department of Languages. This method, which was originally developed for research purposes, yielded promising results in terms of its teaching potential. Therefore it seemed appropriate to consider the practical implementation of the same approach in a real teaching situation in order to transfer the project’s findings into good practice and bridge the gap between research and scholarship. Data collection for the pilot took place between January and July 2014 and the results are currently being processed. This follow-up project was presented at the Open Learning Research and Scholarship forum on the 1st July in a pecha kucha summary entitled Feedback on feedback: Transferring research to scholarship
