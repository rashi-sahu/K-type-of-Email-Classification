Archiving our herstories since 1975
The Feminist Library is a large collection of Women's Liberation Movement literature based in London. We have been supporting research, activist and community projects since 1975.
In 2015 The Feminist Library celebrates 40 years of archiving and activism. Totally volunteer run, we have created and looked after one of the most important collections of feminist material in all of the UK, and provided an inspiring learning and social space for thousands of people.
HELP THE FEMINIST LIBRARY
MOVE TO A A NEW HOME!
Update: Good News - the Library is on its way to a new home – but not for a while!
We are very pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement with Southwark Council to let us stay in our current home until we move into new premises.
Our plan is to move next year into a space at OKRS
(Old Kent Road Studios), a new venue on the Ledbury Estate, SE15.
