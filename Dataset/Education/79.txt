About the ACRID project
The ACRID project is a collaboration between UEA, STFC and the Met Office, funded by
JISC as part of their Managing Research Data programme, with the aim to develop an
approach to publishing climate research data in a way that facilitates citing, re-use
and the provision of full provenance information for processed data.
The Advanced Climate Research Infrastructure for Data (ACRID) project is funded by JISC as part
of their Managing Research Data programme.
This programme is targeting a number of areas, including projects that encourage the publication of
research data using improved methods of citing, linking and integrating datasets.
More information about the ACRID project and how it links into this strand of the JISC Managing
Research Data programme is available
here.
The overall aim of the ACRID project is to implement a linked-data
approach for sharing some example climate datasets, and in doing so develop the necessary architecture, infrastructure
and tools that might be implemented more widely within the climate science community.
The ACRID project will try to
demonstrate how the publication of datasets developed by the climate science community might be improved, so that
the provenance of the published data can be more clearly recorded (e.g. data sources and versions, software versions,
and processing options);
published data can be recreated more straightforwardly from source data even a number of years after publication;
data can be cited in a way that links more directly to the precise version of data that was used and, by using
the linked-data approach, make relationships between different datasets clearly visible.
We will not be aiming to develop an operational system within the ACRID project, though we hope that the project results
will lead to approaches and techniques that the project partners and others might employ in the future.
Although the case studies are key elements of our project, we expect that the approaches and prototypes
we develop, assess and implement will provide useful guidance and exemplars for other areas of climate
science.
