Creating Heritage Artefacts for Research and Teaching in an E-Repositor
Welcome to CHARTER
Project CHARTER aims to create the infrastructure and processes required to capture, document and preserve digital surrogates drawn from the Universityâ€™s Special Collections and to make them available for teaching and research through a new online repository created through the project.
In this funded phase, running from Oct 08 to Sept 09, the new repository will be populated with 4000+ digital surrogates selected within a common theme: their representation of popular culture, 1800-1914.
CHARTER will draw heavily on the collections of the Bill Douglas Centre for the History of Cinema and Popular Culture, as well as the rare book and archive collections. The selection of artefacts will be led by an interdisciplinary team of academics.
This project is funded by JISC as part of the Enriching Digital Resources programme, a strand of the Digitisation programme.
