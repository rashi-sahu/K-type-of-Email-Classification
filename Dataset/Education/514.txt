Welcome to the Enhancement Themes website The Enhancement Themes are selected by the Scottish higher education sector and they provide a means for institutions, academic staff, support staff and students to work together in enhancing the learning experience.
Each Theme facilitates both sharing and learning from current and innovative national and international practice. In addition, the Themes promote the collective development of new ideas and models for innovation in learning and teaching.
Support for the Enhancement Themes is provided by the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education, Scotland (QAA).
Keynote speaker for the Conference confirmed: Professor Elspeth Jones
