ABOUT USOUR PROJECTSData management planning for ESRC research data-rich investmentsThis project, funded under Jisc's Managing Research Data Programme, increased the data management and sharing capability of research hubs within the social sciences through support and training.
In this project the UK Data Archive worked with
ESRC Research Centres and Programmes to expand the
implementation of data management planning procedures, enable
effective data management practices and increase individual and
institutional data management and sharing capacity in research
'hubs'.
The project assessed existing practices and helped develop and
implement through-the-lifecyle effective data management planning
practices, including building capacity. Examples of effective data
management practices and existing expertise from the UK Data
Archive were used to develop best practice guidance and
tools.
The longer-term aim of this project was to engage with challenging
and sensitive aspects of archiving and sharing. This embraces:
informed consent; confidentiality; the ethics of sharing;
copyright; the implications of using secondary data; enhancing
data; preservation formats; storage; security; and back-up.
Ultimately, not only will debate and coordinating strategies on
these issues improve the quality of data, they will also improve
research training in the UK.
A number of training events were held with Centres and as part
of the Jisc Programme during the 18-month period.
Archive contribution

Data Archive directed and managed this project as part of their
wider remit to provide bespoke research data management support and
