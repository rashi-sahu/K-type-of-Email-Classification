“The Datadashboard is a valuable tool in enabling
us to analyse the attainment of our students and develop strategies to continue their improvement, both within individual academies and across the federation.”
"For the LA we are able to analyse and select the most appropriate data from the Post-16 LPUK Datadashboard.
At school level it gives us a strategic management tool for the sixth form - we can see at a glance which areas are doing well and which are underperforming".
"In the London Borough of Haringey all Schools with a Sixth Form are good or outstanding and their performance continues to rise. We use the LPUK Datadashboard as our main Post-16 data tool to support and challenge continued improvements".
"We have used the Post-16 LPUK Datadashboard for several years now because it provides us with almost immediate feedback on the value-added performance of our students following the issue of their advanced level exam results in August".
"We use the Datadashboard to gather evidence for our support and challenge meetings with heads of sixth in our local schools".
"The post 16 datadashboard is an extremely useful tool as it allows me to have well-structured challenge and support meetings with school sixth forms".
"Our data dashboard provides us with a unique set of data not currently available anywhere else.
The data is highly relevant to the cohort of pupils at our school and will enable us to track their learning and development against their learning styles and specific SEN".
