Digital Communication and Student Mental Health
Digital Communication and Student Mental Health is an innovative project funded by JISC (historically the Joint Information Systems Committee) involving the collaboration of staff and students from across the University of Sheffield interested in student mental health.
The main aim of this 18 month project is the development of a web interface for student mental health, which will provide access to a number of resources and digital communication channels for students and staff.
The diagram below represents the main project elements that it is anticipated will feed into the student mental health web interface.
