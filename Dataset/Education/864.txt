The Language Café in Second Life
3D immersive world projects
Since 2007 eLanguages has been involved in a number of projects exploring the use of Second Life in teaching and learning. These have included projects which have investigated the use of Second Life in the teaching and learning of languages in 3D immersive worlds (Cardenio and M3: MUVE, Moodle and Microblogging), and a CLIL (Content and Language Integrated Learning) approach to the teaching of European students of Architecture and Design using immersive worlds (ARCHI21 Project).
eLanguages has also been involved in helping create the University of Southampton island in Second Life, and has developed an area on the island representing the Modern Languages department at the University of Southampton.
