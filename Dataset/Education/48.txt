Carlo Emilio Gadda
The site is organised in two sections:
the Journal proper – a yearly electronic journal entirely dedicated to the study of the works of Carlo Emilio Gadda, Italy’s greatest modernist writer;
the Resource Centre – an extensive reference source for Gadda scholars.
Please click here for news from the Gadda world.
A site-wide search facility is available.
If you are a complete novice to Gaddian matters, then it may be a good idea to visit the Introducing Gadda section first.
