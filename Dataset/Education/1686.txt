Kettle's Yard 3 days ago ‘I will discard 10,000 in my search for one whose outward shape exactly balances my idea of what a pebble is … you may search a wide seashore or the reaches of many rivers and never find one, and then suddenly it lies before you – an ordered unit, shaped of this order from the countless vicissitudes of nature’s course… We find a perfect pebble once in a generation and once in a continent perhaps.’Jim EdeOur #workoftheweek is Jim Ede's 'basket of pebbles'. Read more about this work and Jim Ede's ethos below. You can see this piece and many others from the Kettle's Yard collection at ART at the ARB in our 'Discovery Through Display' exhibition.Acknowledging the significance of pebbles for Jim Ede and Kettle’s Yard, one has been put in the time capsule we placed on site during our Topping Out Ceremony.

A special mention to Dominika Grzeskowik, a student from North Cambridge Academy, who made a small sculpture of a piano in response to her memories of the grand piano in the House at Kettle’s Yard. This sculpture is now part of a time capsule that Dominika placed inside the wall of the new building at the ceremony.For photos and more information on the time capsule and the event, please see our website: www.kettlesyard.co.uk/about/news/topping-ceremony-building-site/ ...

Placed within an academic context, exhibitions such as ‘Discovery Through Display’ can only complement the exchange of ideas and perspectives constantly taking place within the building’s many seminar rooms."Thank you to Lily Spicer and Varsity for a wonderful review of
