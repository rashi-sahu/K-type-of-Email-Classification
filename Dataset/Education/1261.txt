TestimonialsI would just like to thank Step so much for their help in finding us an intern for our company. In particular my online enquiry was very quickly followed up with a phone call and an email with all relevant details. This direct and pragmatic approach did not stop there as Step very quickly put me in contact with two extremely strong interns one of which we have secured for a February start. I am very pleased with the service that has been provided and look forward to working with Step in the future.Robert Matherson, Developer, Create IntelligenceWe needed to strengthen our team with the recruitment of a graduate engineer as our business continues to expand. Step were very proactive in looking for suitable candidates for us whilst keeping us informed at all stages.  Their initial assessment of the applications meant that only suitable candidates made it through to interview, and were all of a high standard. I would have no hesitation in using Step again or in recommending their services to other employers.Sarah Whiteside, Director, MK ProfilesI cannot stress enough how important the skills I’ve learnt are and cannot wait to put them into practice in my future career.Alice, University of ReadingThe team at Step are able to find high calibre students, from relevant courses in the universities of our choosing, saving us considerable time and effort as a business. Our demanding requirements are met year on year and I would recommend them without fail.Gail Cole, HR Manager, PumaThanks once again to Step and the team. Really couldn't ask for more from you guys. Personally one of the best agencies out there that really care about their candidates.Hanif, Queen Mary, University of London alumniThank you Step for your superlative support during this process, we really appreciate how you made the recruitment process so easy!Katie, Director, Tecnon OrbichemI was already learning a huge amount about project planning and management which really helped me build upon the experience I’d had during my university course when managing group projects.James, University of ExeterStep were a fantastic help when we needed to hire graduates for a number of complex projects. Our need for engineers with a strong materials background is quite specific; however Step were able to find excellent engineering candidates who we hired into the business after their internship.Colin Roberson, Advance Defence MaterialsI was surprised by how attentive Step were throughout the process, I got the feeling that the team at Step really cared about guiding me through and wanted to see me succeed.Catherine, Queens University BelfastA really rewarding aspect I found about working in a smaller business is that the impact of your work can be felt around the company, you really are classed as an integral part.Sam, Nottingham Trent UniversityAs a small growing company, we've frequently used Step to source quality enthusiastic graduates to join our entrepreneurial coffee company and help us grow, develop and work on projects that the core team did not have time or resources for. Step are great at listening to our needs as an employer and finding choice candidates for us. Thanks Step!
