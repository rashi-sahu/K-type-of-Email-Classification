Founded in 1860 as the centre for scientific study at the University of Oxford, the Museum of Natural History now holds the Universitys internationally significant collections of geological and zoological specimens. Housed in a stunning example of neo-Gothic architecture, the Museums growing collections underpin a broad programme of natural environment research, teaching and public engagement. Among its most famous features are the Oxfordshire dinosaurs, the Dodo, and the swifts in the tower.
