WelcomeI would like to extend a warm welcome to you on behalf of everyone at William Penn. I believe that our school provides pupils with exciting and challenging learning opportunities. I also feel that our pupils, parents, staff, governors and friends in the wider community are all part of a learning experience. We work together in a caring, family way so that everyone can make progress, experience success and have the confidence to make and evaluate reasoned choices. If you feel that we could help you with any further information, contact us at school and we will gladly be of assistance.

Headteacher

Part 2: Cookies
About cookies
A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.
Cookies may be either "persistent" cookies or "session" cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.
Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.
Cookies can be used by web servers to identity and track users as they navigate different pages on a website and identify users returning to a website.

we use functional cookies on our website to allow eschools.co.uk to remember information you have entered or choices you make and provide enhanced, more personal features. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customize.
We use third-party service providers to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. These service providers may collect your IP address and non-personally identifiable information about your visits to our site in order to serve eSchools ads while you are visiting other websites. Such non-personally identifiable information is anonymous and does not include your name, address, email address or other personal information, however your IP address may be collected. The anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag (also known as cookies and action tags), which is industry-standard technology used by most major websites.
Analytics cookies
We use Google Analytics to analyse the use of our website.
Our analytics service provider generates statistical and other information about website use by means of cookies.
The information generated relating to our website is used to create reports about the use of our website.
