What is ATM?
Home
Membership of ATM is open to all who have an interest in the learning and teaching of mathematics. ATM seeks to support teachers to explore strategies that will enable learners to enjoy and discover mathematics.
We believe that the power to learn rests with the learner and that teaching has a subordinate role. The teacher has a duty to seek out ways to engage the power of the learner.
