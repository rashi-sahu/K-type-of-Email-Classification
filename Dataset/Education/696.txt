The SSBR project delivered Support, Synthesis and Benefits Realisation (SS, BR) services to the JISC Institutional Innovation Programme and its constituent projects. The project was based on a community (network) approach to programme support.
The SSBR final report can be found here.
The support, synthesis and benefits realisation project (SSBR) aimed to foster the development of a community of interest/expertise for the purpose of realising the benefits of the programme.
The project is designed to facilitate network interactions to promote knowledge discovery and exchange in four modes:
peer to peer between the projects,
between the projects and the programme
between project teams and their institutional stakeholders
and between the projects and the wider educational community.
The work plan consisted of support and synthesis activities in two broad, inter-related phases:
discovery, analysis and synthesis (Oct 2008 – January 2010 … and ongoing to March 2011)
benefits realisation (June 2009 – May 2011)
