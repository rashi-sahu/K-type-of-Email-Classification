From the punk exhibition to Jane Eyre. From some of western civilization's best known works of literature to some of our most indigestible swill, the British Library's collection speaks to us as a people.
And what better way to speak to us than through a gift shop?
I'd worked for many years for one of the best known public libraries in the world which has its own gift shop, but hasn't always done a tremendous job at exploring its potential.
Here is where the British Library could give a master class.
Yes, it has any number of things you'd expect: books, of course - children's books, books set in London, etc.
And items with designs inspired by some of the more memorable pieces in its collection, such as magnets & tube card holders.
But where it really shines is the availability of CDs & other media of productions sponsored by the British Library. Readings, musical performances & the like.
After you've enjoyed your time exploring the library itself, do make a point of browsing the shop. अधिक देखेंKelly Wood-barlow · 3 फ़रवरी 2017the library is more than a library, it has great historical items, great, Important, historical pieces of writing, original handwriting from famous writers to g...reat minds, I particularly enjoyed all the ancient historical sacred texts, and of course the Magna Carta, in the room with the Magna Carta, the original book wasn't there ( it had temporarily been removed- that was shame) however, all the wording and descriptions were of course there, along with the videos and texts etc ... It's great to see that
so many students studying in there, if all the libraries in the country were like this, we certainly wouldn't have any problems with getting any child or adult to pick up a book and read it, nor any funding issues.
The staff were all very friendly and extremely helpful, except the one who gave me strong words and a glare for me taking photographs of the things that interested me- I don't know why they do not allow this? I've been in many museums around the world and some of
them allow you to take photos ( and rightly so) and some don't.
I spent several hours in here and I had a great day! I would highly recommend to anybody, and to all ages. The ancient books going from floor to ceiling, up the centre of the building are breath taking- I wasn't sure that this section was open to the public- I think it was just for the staff and for display.
The gift shop is good & the cafe is good.
Most definitely located in a fabulous part of London, with lots of other wonderful museums nearby to check out, along with top notch hotels, restaurants, pubs & bars playing live music. I think the name of the place should be brought up to modern times and changed to ... The British Library #museum अधिक देखेंDebbie Frearson · 9 फ़रवरी 2017We visited the library yesterday with the sole purpose of viewing the Jane Austen papers, it was a delight to view all the other documents in the room but there... were some fundamental problems.
The items on display were not in the best position in the cases, you had to lean quite a way with poor light (obviously for conservation), this is fine for a couple of viewings, but the whole room was like this.
This led to eye strain and back ache because it took a while to go around everything.
It would have been far better to have had translations of the pages on every document (including religious texts) available to view, we could have seen and admired the originals in their display case, then taken time to read what they said.
Jane Austen had a few sentences on the information plaques, but they were a bit dull.
I would have preferred this to the tv screens with the digitisation which showed exactly the same as the cases. अधिक देखेंKhalida Ali · 14 फ़रवरी 2017Me and my daughters had only a short time here as we would be leaving London a few hours later. I don't know what the issue was but we were constantly followed ...around to the point my daughters wanted to leave. Due to a jam packed visit my youngest was tired and wanted to just sit on the benches but this was fine as long as myself and my older daughter could explore the library.
We finally decided to leave but popped into the shop only to have a security guard shadow us through out. Totally ruined the experience and showed how judgemental and racist some staff are. Your staff or whoever decides who to shadow need serious training
I'd most definitely not recommend to any other women wearing a scarf for faith purposes. अधिक देखेंNikki Barber · 21 नवंबर 2016Frequently a port in a storm for me and it was great to take my nephew and niece to show them our national library, the Treasures exhibition and the contemporar...y mappa mundi from Hereford Cathedral right at the top level. I wanted to fan the flames for a love of learning and reading and this is why I brought them they are 7 and 9. They liked the music scores in the Treasures and the scale of the books towering up high in the central bit. The hot chocolate was well received too. अधिक देखेंSharon O'Connor · 4 दिसंबर 2016The food has really gone down hill since the new contractors Graysons have taken over. I used to love the mushroom pie from Peyton and Byrne, a much classier ca...terer and what I would expect from such a fantastic place as the British Library. You need to monitor the quality of the food offered. Yuk! अधिक देखेंKaustubh KP Prabhu · 21 जनवरी 2017It was a fascinating experience for me. I had reserved a couple of books online for my research and it was so easy to get hold of a Readers' pass, that meant I ...could access most areas of the Library. The common areas were busy and I couldn't find a place to sit, but the staff were super helpful and facilities outstanding. Definitely returning. अधिक देखेंRuss Sharp · 29 नवंबर 2016The amount of access to all books is obviously great. It would be nice if the librarians could do a full days work like everybody else and open the reading rooms from 9am. Cafe is stupidly expensive for what it is. They could also put the thermostat up a bit in the reading rooms.Bryan Machin · 29 जनवरी 2017Although we only had 75 minutes to look round I saw enough to wet my appetite to come back again. This was my first visit and hope it will not be my last. The s...hortage of time was due to the fact it was an impulse visit and a Saturday afternoon, so next time will be better organised. Overall I was blown away with what I saw. अधिक देखेंMariam Pal · 26 नवंबर 2016I love the British Library. It is a welcoming place where I felt at home immediately. Physically the architecture is beautiful.
I had applied for readers card ...from Canada and was able to complete my registration quickly and efficiently with the help of very nice staff. Getting my books was easy.
I spent time in the Asian reading room which is a very well appointed and comfortable place to read and take notes.
I had several meals in the Kings restaurant which were very nice and picked up a few things in the gift shop. All in all I'm glad I discovered the British Library. अधिक देखेंDavid Bowden · 19 दिसंबर 2016My first visit as I needed to kill time before my train left kings Cross. I went in to see "Maps and the 20th Century" and I'm obviously not a typical visitor as the Curator did a double take when I presented my ticket. Never the less it was well worth the visit, thank you.Jo Carter · 29 जनवरी 2017We visited the Maps Exhibition, which we paid £6 instead of the £12 entrance fee (Art Card holders). It was really interesting and there was quite a lot to see. We wandered into the general exhibition area and if you're a bibliophile, it's a great place to go.Wendy Parkinson · 18 दिसंबर 2016The design of the place is brilliant and the collection of original exhibits is amazing. Will have to go back when the Magna Carta has finished its tour!Denise Brown · 16 जनवरी 2017The content of the map exhibition. Is amazing but the curation left a great deal to be desired. They need someone from Compton Verney to show them how to do it.Peta Strachan · 1 दिसंबर 2016Even though I didn't get to see everything; this was an incredible experience. I will definitely visit again especially to see the early writings of the greats:... Shakespeare, Hardy, Wilfred Owen to name a few. It is fascinating to see the early drafts and the changes their craft went through. .. I am excited to look at these again.
Truly wonderfully awesome. अधिक देखेंYehor Brailian · 7 दिसंबर 2016Good evening !

At the time, people believed that the earth was at the centre of the universe, and that the sun and planets revolved around it. But this model couldn't explain the patterns seen in paths through the sky over time.
Copernicus argued that the positions of the stars and planetary orbits could be better explained by the sun being at the centre of the universe with the planets rotating around it.

She confides that her father is unable to provide as substantial a dowry as they had hoped. However, she says, if John loves her he will marry her anyway: 'But if you love me, as I trust verily that you do, you will not leave me therefore.' The couple would eventually marry and their son, William,

She provides a comic account of England from Henry IV to Charles I as told by ‘a partial, prejudiced, & ignorant historian’. The narrator can be seen to be frequently distracted by his or her opinions of the events and people being described. A note on the bottom of the first page also marks out the tone of the tale: ‘N.B. There will be very few Dates in this his...tory’.
