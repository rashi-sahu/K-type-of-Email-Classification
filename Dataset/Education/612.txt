Heads of Educational Development Group
Strategic Approach to Dissemination of Digital Literacies for Enhancement (SADDLE)
Introduction
The Heads of Educational Development Group (HEDG) is a network organisation for institutional leaders with direct responsibility for learning and teaching enhancement in UK Higher Education institutions, and with a common remit for informing institutional strategy and translating it into academic practice. Typically this is achieved through academic staff development, educational innovation projects, postgraduates programmes for new or experienced staff, curriculum development and research projects and through contributions to committees, advisory work and national and regional networks.
HEDG and Digital Literacy
HEDG members’ strategic remits for learning and teaching enhancement, and associated change management processes, and their close working relations with/ responsibility for  e-Learning/Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL)  makes them ideally placed to influence institutional policy and strategy in the area of digital literacies.
As one of 11 sector bodies and professional associations funded through the Associations Strand of the JISC Developing Digital Literacies (DDL) programme, HEDG is working with the DDL programme on supporting activities to realise the benefits for staff and students in further and higher education.
The project objectives were:
to identify how learning from the
DDL projects can feed into the professional practice of educational developers
and, particularly, the strategic roles of heads of educational development,
in leading and supporting approaches to developing digital literacy
To build capacity for digital
literacy in the HEDG community of practice and to identify untapped
efficiencies and opportunities in the areas of people development and
strategic change management
