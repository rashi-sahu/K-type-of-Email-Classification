Mandate | About mandate
This project is funded by the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC).
The aim of the project is to develop a toolkit to support the
creation and implementation of digital asset management and
preservation in the further education setting, and demonstrate its
application in the setting of John Wheatley College (JWC).
The toolkit is available here.
The project will format, index, and store existing unstructured
digital materials created in currently disparate processes and from
the research practice create and test templates and workflow models
for routine use in John Wheatley College and for application across
the sector. The project will develop appropriate structures for
web-based storage of information that will contribute to the end
goal of improved digital preservation.
The project will examine the roles of various staff
â€“ teaching
staff, librarians, administrators, technicians - in the creation of
appropriate metadata and will apply quality control mechanisms to
support correct application.
The project will support the establishment of routines which
address issues associated with the creation of documents related to
quality assurance for learning programmes and associated learning
materials in terms of their metadata declaration, and the roles of,
and collaboration between administrative staff, teaching and other
curricular support staff and library staff. The project will examine
the roles of and relationships between these staffing groups and
develop workflow models and templates to support the effective
creation of metadata suitable for storage and retrieval processes
and also suitable for supporting managed information lifecycles.
The toolkit will be made available on the project website and in
appropriate repositories, and will include:
Support for assessment of initial college position
Database specifications
Metadata collection templates
Cross-walks and mappings
Workflow process diagrams and explanations
Model strategy for adaptation and use by other colleges
Project report (including case study)
Training Programme specification
Case Study of application of toolkit in John Wheatley College
