What
does WAGNet do?
WAGNet brings
together people working in the
field of gender and China to help  researchers exchange
information and keep up to date with developments and
publications.
The WAGNet
databases and mailing
list are
available for members to disseminate and update pertinent information
on work in gender and Chinese studies
The WAGNet News
Blog makes available news of
workshops, conferences (that
is, of any
event anywhere in Europe of relevance to the Network), funding and
fellowship opportunities and calls for papers in the areas of gender
and China.
The WAGNet
Website gives information on new publications in all
European
languages within women's/gender studies in China; publication details
are accompanied by a short synopsis of content.
The purpose of
WAGnet is to facilitate communication and the exchange of ideas and
information.
Background
The
Women and
Gender in Chinese Studies Network
(WAGNet) was
inaugurated on the 12th
August 2001 in Berlin.
'We
were motivated
into action by the relative
invisibility of
women's and gender studies scholarship at the European Association of
Chinese Studies (EACS) conference in Torino (2000) where only a
minority of European scholars and students in the field were present.
We feel that the time has come for a
stronger, concentrated presence.
The website will provide a central, accessible site for information,
knowledge, communication, facilitation and action to reach beyond
linguistic and national barriers to common concerns and priorities. The
Network will be what members wish to make of it.
'Our
concern is to
link European scholarship in
Chinese
women's/gender studies, in all its linguistic diversity. While
a main aim is to bring together European scholars, so that we know who
is working where, in which disciplines and on which issues,
the Network is open to our colleagues in Asia and other parts of the
world. We will also be integrating this Network, as
quickly as possible, into the global network of China-related women and
gender studies for wider access and communication.'
