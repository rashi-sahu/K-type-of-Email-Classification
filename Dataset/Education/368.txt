What is DaMaRO?
The Data Management Rollout at Oxford (DaMaRO) Project is creating a research
data management policy for the University and the infrastructure to enable
researchers to comply with it.
A high-level Research Data Management Working Group has been convened to
ensure that the Project's activities are coordinated with the strategic
interests of the University of Oxford. This group consists of senior members
of Research Services, IT Services, and the Bodleian Libraries. Members of the Working
Group organised a 'Digital Services
to Support Research' workshop in July 2012 to consider the various
components of a University infrastructure, and now meets bi-monthly.
The Damaro Project will be taking the outputs of the various research data
management projects that the University has been engaged in over the last
few years and combining them into a better-integrated suite of tools and
discovery mechanisms that will support researchers throughout the data
life-cycle, from planning to re-use.
Of particular note is the ‘DataFinder’ tool that DaMaRO will be developing.
This will enable the discovery of data hosted in various places around the
University and beyond, including the Bodleian Libraries' 'DataBank'
(developed through the Admiral and DataFlow projects), the Online Research Database Service (ORDS) (created during the Sudamih and VIDaaS Projects),
departmental and other local data stores, the Web 2 research management
network 'Colwiz', and hopefully
the 'LabTrove' system developed
by the University of Southampton. It will also connect this data with
research papers and publications held in the Oxford University Research Archive
(ORA).
Behind the scenes, DataFinder will be able to automatically gather metadata
from each of the tools and repositories it connects to, assign DOIs where
they are not already assigned, and ensure that the metadata complies with
the national DataCite standards.
Furthermore, DataFinder will make the metadata it gathers available as
linked data, and also map it to the CERIF standard, so that alerts can be issued to compatible
research management systems when new project outputs are made available.
DataFinder will be designed so as to be implementable as a hierarchical
structure, so that an institutional instance can harvest data from
departmental instances and, ultimately, a national instance could harvest
the data from institutional instances, forming a UK data discovery tool.
DataFinder will be a freely-available web service.
Besides software development, the DaMaRO Project will develop data management
training and documentation for researchers, expanding and adding to the
materials developed during the Sudamih Project and the other projects funded by the JISC
Managing Research Data Programme. A long-term business plan for
providing and maintaining the DaMaRO enterprise environment will also be
developed during the course of the project.
DaMaRO will work alongside the Oxford DMP Online
Project to ensure that the mechanisms it develops are integrated
with data management planning tools used in the University.

DaMaRO is funded under the JISC's Managing
Research Data (JISCMRD) Programme.
