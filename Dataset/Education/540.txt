Introduction
FAILTE aims to provide a unified approach to the description and cataloguing of electronic learning resources for engineering. We are building an internet resource catalogue and other services which we hope will
help lecturers select and access suitable computer- and web-based learning materials for their courses.
SearchLT, the service we are developing is available at searchLT.engineering.ac.uk, but pleased be warned that this is a work in progress, and will improve with time. You can also access SearchLT via the EEVL engineering website
