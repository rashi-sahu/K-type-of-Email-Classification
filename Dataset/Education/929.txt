NeuroHub: the information environment for Neuroscientists
Overview
This JISC funded project will develop a set of sustainable tools and framework that will allow neuroscientists to efficiently and effectively use existing e-Infrastructure and by doing so will enable a more productive research cycle, streamlining the laboratory experience from conception of experiment to publication of the research results. The framework and tools will be the product of in depth user requirements analysis, adaptation of existing software, development of key missing components and a tight collaboration between neuroscientists, technologists and resource providers at three HEIs. The collaboration leverages the e-Research South consortium and builds on both a strategic regional activity and University strategy that will provide sustainability beyond the lifetime of the project. The research outputs will include open source software as well as best practice guides and training material.
