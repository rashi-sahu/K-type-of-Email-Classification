providing advice and guidance on digital assessment and e-marking and e-feedback methods (including rubrics, statement banks, audio feedback, etc)
troubleshooting and providing ‘how to’ advice on the use of learning technologies
showcasing examples of technology-enhanced learning and teaching practices and facilitating networking and discussions to share best practice
