What the Project is doing?
This project will address the area of interactions between repositories
of primary research data, the laboratory environment in which they operate
and repositories of research publications into which they ultimately feed
(through documented interpretation and analysis of the results and in
explicit linking and citation of the data sets). It will develop prototype
services and tools to address the issues of working with, disseminating
and reporting on experimental data. In collaboration with scientific equipment
manufacturers the project will develop methods to make raw experimental
data available and richly annotated with metadata, as it is generated
in the laboratory. The possibilities for aggregating heterogeneous raw
experimental data from different sources and experiments, via effective
management of the repository for the laboratory, will also be explored
and prototype tools developed to enable, manipulate and derive reports
for publication purposes. It will also engage in discussions with publishers
and societies to determine anticipated requirements. More ...
