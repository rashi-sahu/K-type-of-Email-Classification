Converge Challenge 2017 launches
Converge Challenge 2017, the entrepreneurial development competition for students and staff at Scottish universities, was launched by its alumni at the University of St Andrews. This year the total prize fund is valued at over £150,000.
The SFC-funded competition focuses on practical hands-on training, with participants taking part in an intensive entrepreneurial development programme that includes 1-2-1 bespoke advice and support, mentoring, pitching
experience and networking opportunities.
Converge Challenge is open from 7 February until Monday 10 April.
Winners will be announced at an awards ceremony at the Glasgow Science Centre in September.
Between 2011-2015, the initiative has trained 240 entrepreneurs that have formed 62 companies, secured over £39 million of follow-on funding and created 175 new jobs.
