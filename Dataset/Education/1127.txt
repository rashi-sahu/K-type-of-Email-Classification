This project is funded by the Joint Information Systems Committee
Data Management Infrastructure Programme: Business Models, Cost and Benefit Analyses Support Role IntroductionHigher
education institutions are coming under increasing pressure to manage
the research data generated by their researchers that cannot be curated
by subject-based data centres - and many are unsure how to proceed given
the absence of clear good practice.To address such concerns, JISCâs Managing Research Data programme
has, with an investment of nearly Â£2M, funded eight projects to provide
the UK Higher Education sector with examples of good research data
management.The projects are first identifying
requirements to manage data created by researchers within an
institution, or across a group of institutions, and then piloting
research data management infrastructures at institutional, departmental
or research group level, to address these requirements. In order better
to understand the investment and change that may be required,
cost-benefit analysis is included in the projectsâ work.Charles
Beagrie Ltd is providing consultancy support to the programme on the
Â business models and cost and benefit analyses. The consultancy will:Â·Prepare a programme guide on cost/benefitanalyses for research data;Â·Contribute to programme meetings;Â·Undertake site visits to support projects;Â·Moderate and write-up a workshop oncosts/benefits with projects;Â·Write a report for JISC with a summation and analysis of cost/benefit work by the projects. Regular updates on the support project will be posted to the Charles Beagrie Blog. Programme Guide to Cost/Benefit Analyses for Research DataThere
are still only a relatively small number of socio-economic studies
focussing specifically on data services or research support rather than
research per se. However, such work is now beginning to be funded
particularly in the UK and producing some promising results. Other
research funders who have been investing in developing socio-economic
impact studies and methodologies for their research also believe that
methods that have been applied to research can also be applied to their
investments in data repositories and data management. Similarly existing
econometric methodologies have been applied in business cases for some
data infrastructures by European organisations.A bibliography with short summary abstracts of such studies is provided in theÂ programme guideÂ (copies
circulated to projects). For assessing costs we would recommend the
activity-based costing approach, which is widely used in other sectors
and has been taken up by projects such the NSA Cost Estimation Tool(NASA
CET), the LIFE project, and Keeping Research Data Safe
(KRDS). KRDS is our recommended tool for the programme as it has been
specifically developed for research data in the UK by JISC and builds on
and leverages any relevant work completed by NASA CET and LIFE.For
assessing benefits, KRDS2 will also contain a benefits framework and
two benefits case studies. The activity based costing approach can
assist in quantifying director counter-factual economic benefits. For
assessing intangible benefits, the balance score card has been widely
used in the not for profit sector and was applied in the JISC funded espidaÂ project.
Although espida focussed specifically on preservation, its general
discussion of the balanced scorecard method also may be helpful to the
DMIprogramme projects.KRDS User GuideTheÂ KRDS User Guide (PDF File)Â -
Â The KRDS User Guide is an edited selection and synthesis of the
guidance in the KRDS reports combined with newly commissioned text and
illustrations. It is intended to act as a concise practical manual for
KRDS users. Its creation has been funded through the JISC Managing
Research Data Programme.Business Cases and Benefits Case StudiesTemplates
and guidance to help prepare full or preliminary business cases have
been made available to JISCMRD projects. Templates and guidance for
benefits case studies and worked examples have also been circulated.
