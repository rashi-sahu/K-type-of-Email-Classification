The University of Oxford and OCLC Research, in partnership with the University of North Carolina, Charlotte, are collaborating on a JISC-funded study to investigate the theory of digital residents and visitors with learners in the educational stages: Emerging (Late stage secondary school-first year undergraduate); Establishing (Second/third year undergraduate); Embedding (Postgraduates, PhD students); and Experienced (Scholars).
This work will increase understanding of how learners engage with the Web and how educational services and systems can attract and sustain a possible new group of lifelong learners. The trans-Atlantic partnership will support comparison of students' digital learning strategies in different cultural contexts. Further details...
