Upcoming Event: “Geospatial” in the
Cultural Heritage domain, past, present and future
Feb 212012
We are very excited to announce that bookings are now open for the next JISC GECO workshop!
“Geospatial” in the  Cultural Heritage domain, past, present and future (#geocult) , taking place on Wednesday 7th March 2012 in London,  will be an opportunity to explore how digitised cultural heritage content can be exploited through geographical approaches and the types of tools and techniques that can be used with geo-referenced/geotagged content.
Issues we are keen to discuss include selection of maps/materials, issues of accuracy and precision, staff and technical requirements, sustainability, licensing.
The event will take place at Maughan Library, Chancery Lane, part of Kings College London. We are most grateful to the lovely people at the KCL Centre for e-Research for securing us this super location.

Happy New Year from JISC GECO!
Jan 092012
A Very Happy New Year from all at the JISC GECO project!
The JISC geo projects have all presented their final products to the world at the end of 2011 and we are looking forward to seeing how those tools and resources are used by the community throughout 2012 – and you have a favourite project, a great example of how you are using one of the products created or ideas for how they should be developed we’d love to hear from you.
We expect 2012 to be an exciting year for all things geo – it is after all the centenary of the Scott Expedition to the South Pole and the year in which the London Olympics will create a whole new excuse for geospatial tie-ins and visualisations!  The JISC GECO team will be blogging about geo and INSPIRE throughout the year and we will also be running several events this spring beginning, kicking off with a geo culture event in late February. If you are interested in taking part please drop us an email or watch out for further news here on the blog.
As ever we welcome guest posts, particularly from UK Further and Higher Education geo community, and your suggestions for posts or events that should be mentioned here.  In the meantime here is something sparkly to properly celebrate the fact that it’s a brand new year!

How do you solve a problem like Geo? Highlights from the JISC Geo Event and Discussions
Dec 212011
It’s been a few weeks since the JISC Geo Tech & Tools Product Launch event at London so we thought it was time we updated you on some of the follow up activities…
On the second day of the JISC Geospatial Event in London, we had two sessions to gather around tables (and/or move between them) and discuss some questions around the themes emerging from the JISC Geo projects. It followed on from the previous days thoughts “to figure out which products are going to help catalyse the spatial revolution in .AC.UKs”, but this session involved discussion that looked out wider than the presented products.
In session 1 discussions included:
How do we get faculty/students to support students in spatial, scribed by GeoCrimeData
What human infrastructure do institutions need to establish for a spatial foundation?, scribed by ELOGeo.
How do we balance supporting novice spatial users alongside experts? Or, is geospatial analysis necessarily GIS?, scribed by Pelagios.
How to fully exploit spatial analysis within research. (2nd half of blog post), scribed by STEEV.
How spatial and temporal analysis can enhance research. (1st half of blog post), scribed by STEEV.
For session 2 themes running through the projects and 6 stages/ways of working with data were identified and discussed.
Creating geospatial data
Managing geospatial data, scribed by U-Geo.
Repurposing geospatial data, scribed by Halogen.
Analyising geospatial data
Sharing geospatial data, scribed by ELOGeo.
Expressing geospatial data
We would love to hear your thoughts on the discussions – leave your comments on any of the blog posts linked to here or add your comments on any of these topics here. If you were part of these discussions and think an important point didn’t get noted down, do add it as a comment as well.
We will be sharing more materials from the JISC Geo End of Programme events early in 2012 but in the meantime here are some video highlights – also available from our new Podcast stream [Click on subscribe via iTunes] – to enjoy:

Space and Time in the Digital Humanities Workshop, hosted by NeDiMAH and JISC LiveBlog
Nov 302011
Today we are liveblogging from the Space and Time in the Digital Humanities Workshop, hosted by NeDiMAH and JISC which is taking place in London and follows on (in the same venue) from the JISC Geo meeting earlier in the week. As usual this is a liveblog so all of the same caveats as normal apply about errors and omissions. The hashtag for today is: #spacetimewg
Leif Isaksen (also of the PELAGIOS project) is introducing us to the day by saying that Greenwich is the place where space and particularly time is measured from. If you go out into Greenwich you will see a big laser in the sky and that’s the Greenwich Meridian. And if you look at Ptolomy’s Greek Parallels Intercept you will see that London is also marked there. Ptolomy’s regular grid was the first to start looking at time in
NeDiMAH is a new funded network for Digital Methods in Humanities and Arts from the European Science Foundation with objectives to create a map visualizing the use of digital research across Europe; an ontology of digital research methods; a collaborative interactive online forum for the European community of practioners active in the area. There are also a number of working groups.

JISC Geo Programme Meeting – Day Two
Nov 292011
Today we are in day two of the JISC Geo Programme Meeting and we are liveblogging as appropriate – so any spelling issues etc. will be corrected as soon as possible – please do comment on content etc. below.
David Flanders of JISC is introducing the day: The aim of today is to identify recommendations for the future.
There will be three sessions which run as presentation and then break out groups around a theme. Each table will have a scribe. The goal will be to discuss potential recommendations for how JISC should advance spatial. That recommendation will then be written up by the project manager and the scribe for a given group and posted on that project’s blog and they can then be looked at further, a soft of ad-hoc community consultation. We will run this process three times today.

JISC Geo Programme Meeting – Day One – Show & Tell
Nov 282011
Today we are blogging from the JISC Geo Show & Tell event taking place at RAVE (Ravensborough College), which sits right next to the Millennium Dome/O2 Arena in London. The hashtag for today is #jiscgeo – please tag any of your own blog posts, images or tweets with this. The full programme of JISC Geo Programme Meeting events over the next few days can be found here.
The day will split into 2 halfs. This morning we will have a Keynote from Julie Sweetkind-Singer, Assistant Director of Geospatial, Cartographic and Scientific Data & Services, Stanford University. This will be followed by an introduction to all of the JISC Geo projects by David F Flanders, JISC Programme Manager for Geospatial Innovation. Then we will break for lunch and in the second half of the day there will be a Show & Tell session where each project shows off their work around lab-style tables. We will be liveblogging the first half of the day but then manning both a INSPIRE table and a JISC GECO events table so we will blog highlights of this afternoon towards the end of the day.
David Flanders, is introducing us to the day with an alert to keep that QR code reader app handy – there’ll be lots of QR codes appearing through the day… Also there will be blogging, tweeting, images, videos, etc. going on all day. All of these should be available under Creative Commons licences and available after the event. Please make your posts etc. available similarly and use the #jiscgeo hashtag.
