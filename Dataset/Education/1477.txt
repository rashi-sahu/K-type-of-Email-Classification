Welcome to the E-Learning Framework Site
The ELF is an international effort to develop a service-orientated approach to the development and integration of computer systems in the sphere of learning, research and education administration. It has now been subsumed into the wider e-framework initiative, which encompasses Information Technology, Research, Library, Administration in addition to Learning & Teaching.

The e-Framework and the ELF
JISC and DEST alongside other international partners are broadening the service-oriented approach into services for Research and Administration to compliment e-Learning.
TALL study in ELF Project Directory
Oxford University's Technology Assisted Lifelong Learning Unit developed a study of e-Learning systems and their relevance to the ELF. The report, is now available as part of the ELF Project Directory. To view the project go to: www.elframework.org/projects/tall/
WS-Reliable Messaging initiative to go to OASIS
With a call for participation, the first step has been taken for the widely used WS Reliable Messaging (WS-RM) spec to be developed further in OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards). WS-RM has been developed so far by Microsoft, IBM and others, but not their main competitors, and also not as an open standard. Moving it to the OASIS non-profit standards organisation could change that.
IMS Release General Webservices
IMS have released the public draft of their new General Web Sevices specification. The spec uses a profile of WS-I but narrows things down further in terms of messaging and error handling.
No upcoming events.
