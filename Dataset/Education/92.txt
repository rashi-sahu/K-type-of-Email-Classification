For details click here
Project InformationStart date: 1 June 2007 End date: 31 March 2009
The aim of the ART project is to develop a tool based on a generic ontology of experiments EXPO to assist in:
Translating scientific papers into format with an explicit semantics
Explicit linking of repository papers to data and metadata
Creation of an example intelligent digital repository.
The proposal is to use the semantically rich and the theoretically sound generic EXPO representation of scientific experiments to provide metadata and to annotate papers stored in digital repositories. An ontology-based tool will be developed to automate the process of translating the papers into the proposed semantic format.
