The APT STAIRS PROJECT
[Appropriate and Practical Technologies for Students, Teachers, Administrators and Researchers.]
The APTSTAIRS project is testing new collaborative technologies to create a common space where users (students, teachers, administrators and researchers) with different skills can work online together.   The project is focusing on the use of Google Docs and other online document creation tools to ensure uptake and adoption across the six partners in the Bloomsbury Colleges consortium.
The Bloomsbury Colleges comprise six internationally renowned HE institutions within the University of London; Birkbeck College, Institute of Education (IoE), School of Pharmacy (SoP),School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), The Royal Veterinary College (RVC).  The Colleges collectively have over 15,000 undergraduate and 14,000 postgraduate students.
We are using JISC funding to run 6 demonstrator projects across the six Bloomsbury institutions.   These demonstrator projects are examining how the latest online collaborative tools (Google Docs) can engage all users in supporting and developing learning, teaching, administration and research.
