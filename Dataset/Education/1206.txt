Shibboleth: Connecting People & Resources
The SWISh (South West Implementation of Shibboleth) project was proposed by the University of Exeter
in response to the JISC Circular 11/04: Core Middleware - Early Adopters, in which institutions were invited to become early adopters of the next generation of tools to manage access to online resources. The SWISh project was undertaken from June 2005 to May 2006.
The project, a collaboration between the Library and I.T. Services, was funded by the JISC to become an early adopter of Shibboleth technology - the
replacement, in the future, for the ATHENS Devolved Authentication system currently in use at the University of Exeter.
