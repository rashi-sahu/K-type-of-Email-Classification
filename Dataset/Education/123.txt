Final Progress Post
December 11, 2009
Just a note to say that this WONâ€™T be the final post on the blog, however, it is the â€˜Final Progress Postâ€™ in terms of the requirements of the ArtNotes (RTNOTES) JISCRI projectâ€¦ so letâ€™s beginâ€¦
Title of Primary Project Output
ArtNotes : An iPhone application for thematically organising images and other visual artefacts.
Project Tag
RTNOTES
Screenshots
Description of Prototype
The prototype demonstrates the ability to organise images in thematically related categories displayed in the application as â€˜Notebooksâ€™, allowing the ability for cross-boundary images to be displayed in multiple â€˜Notebooksâ€™.
In order to enhance the application there is the ability to import and export images from the devices built in photo library and camera, as well as Flickr, perhaps the most popular online repository for images.
Alongside the image itself, the application caters for storage of various elements of meta-data including the â€˜geo-tagâ€™ of an image which may then be displayed on a map as a series of â€˜pinsâ€™.
The prototype has focused on the core idea behind the project, that of organisation and storage. Features which are desired, yet lack a fully tested implementation include:
Complete Flickr synchronisation
Integration with other repositories such as Google Images
During the course of the development a variety of potential areas for expansion were identified, however as these are potential areas for future work and not directly related to the project they are not included for brevity.
Link to Working Prototype
As the iPhone is a closed platform, a working prototype is unavailable, except from the App Store. Â ArtNotes is undergoing a final round of testing and failing any major problems will be submitted to the App Store over the Christmas period.
However, the â€˜End User Documentationâ€™ below and the screenshots above should give an overview of the functioning application.
Link to End User Documentation
The â€˜End User Documentationâ€™ is slightly lacking, as it was delivered to testers and potential end users in a presentation format, alongside a â€˜live demoâ€™ of the application.
The following link provides a downloadable copy of the latest presentation in PPSX format:
http://artnotes.googlecode.com/files/EndUserDocumentation.ppsx
Link to Code Repository or API
The code repository can be found here: http://artnotes.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ArtNotes/
This contains a buildable MonoTouch solution for the ArtNotes project.
Link to Technical Documentation
Unfortunately, there seems to be a slight issues with MonoDevelop, in that it currently doesnâ€™t generate the XML docs for a MonoTouch project (the actual issue is that smcs doesnâ€™t support the â€˜/docâ€™ option). As such this means the technical documentation is limited to the comments and functional descriptions found inside the source code files.
However, if the XML docs can be generated this will be updated and a link will be provided.
The source code, as above, can be found here: http://artnotes.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ArtNotes/
Date Prototype was Launched
The latest build of the application was given to testers / end users 2009.12.09

Table of Content for Project Posts
This section gives a list of the relevant posts on the blog from the project. It is broken into 4 categories:
Initiation â€“ The beginning of the project and the initial set up
Issues and Reflections â€“ More could perhaps have been done in terms of reflection, however in terms of problems (aside from time :)) the only real issues were that of hardware and software availability
Progress â€“ Some posts showing the progress which was made with the project
Community â€“ Posts which are related to the â€˜Open Sourceâ€™ community. As the project was licensed under the GPL v2 and is available on Google Code, it was decided that if anything specific, which may be useful to others, was written it could be presented as such. The posts listed are linked to from the MonoTouch wiki (http://wiki.monotouch.net) or from MonoTouch.Info (http://www.monotouch.info).

Download
December 3, 2009
If you want to download and build the current version of ArtNotes, you can get it here ArtNotes-2009.12.03.zip
Due to the requirements of the project sponsors, itâ€™s licensed under the GPL, however as I wrote the code, I can license it as I want, so if you want to use any of it (maybe under a different license?) feel free to contact me ðŸ™‚
Edit: If you download the code you might notice that the quality can be somewhat lacking. This is the joy of deadlines. I am, however, planning on revisiting and refactoring the worst bits :).

The Crunch
December 3, 2009
Again, itâ€™s been a while since the last post. Something which I must apologise for yet again. Itâ€™s been really busy round here, lots of meetings and other University stuff which has managed to sap all my time.
Iâ€™ve also been working hard getting ArtNotes into a more workable product. Itâ€™s gotten pretty good, and the people whoâ€™ve used it seem to think the stuff it does is good although they pretty much all agree that the interface needs more work.

Source Code Availability
November 20, 2009
Now Iâ€™ve finally gotten my new MacBook, an Enterprise version of MonoTouch and my iPhone Developer access (and have tested the code on the phone) Iâ€™ve commited the project into SVN here: http://code.google.com/p/artnotes
Please note though, this is *just* an initial version, there is functionality left to implement (technically Iâ€™ve already implemented it, it just needs porting from various testing projects), so be aware.

iPhone Developer Programme
November 20, 2009
Youâ€™d think it would be easy to join wouldnâ€™t you? Maybe it is if youâ€™re paying for it yourself, otherwise itâ€™s what I would like to term a complete cluster-fungle.
Still, after much gnashing of teeth and calls to Apple, Iâ€™m finally enrolled under *my own name*. w00t!

BarCamp London 7 (A retrospectiveÂ :o)
November 20, 2009
A couple of weeks ago now a couple of us went down to BarCamp London 7, held in the IBM building on the south bank.
As a start, I think iâ€™ll talk about the facilitiesâ€¦ The IBM building was a great place to have the event. The building itself looks very 1960â€™s concrete lovinâ€™ from the outside, but when you get in, youâ€™re greeted by a light, airy, modern building. The general feel of the place was very nice, (and somewhere I could see myself working :o). You got a great view of the Thames from the many cafeterias and eating spaces around the building and there were plenty of meeting / break-out rooms for discussions to happen (not like BarCamp Manchester 2, but thatâ€™s another post). Overall, a great place to have the BarCamp.
The BarCamp itself was very good, a few cool free gifts and lots of great free food and snacks (of course, it always tastes better when itâ€™s free, doesnâ€™t it?). For the most part, the presentations we attended were very interesting, ranging from some pretty technical talks from a couple of IBM guys all the way through to a talk on how to speak Dutch. I donâ€™t think I saw anything that wasnâ€™t interesting in some way.
We also got interviewed by Milly Shaw who is part of the JISC DevCSI project, which made it a little more interesting. (And meant I had to think of something to sayâ€¦)
Unfortunately, we didnâ€™t stay overnight at the BarCamp, rather we retreated to our hotel room at the rather nice Strand Palace. The reason for this is perhaps a little lame, but as we came down on Friday night, we needed somewhere to stay and thus our hotel was booked for both Friday and Saturday night (that and I didnâ€™t remember my sleeping bag).
Overall it was a great event, met some interesting people from a wide range of disciplines and something I would definitely recommend people go to if they have the chance!
TLDR: IBM building is cool; BarCamp was fun.

Apologies
November 20, 2009
Hmmâ€¦ so much for putting up a review of BCL7 within the next few daysâ€¦ as you can probably tell, that didnâ€™t quite work out.
Thereâ€™s not any specific reason that I havenâ€™t updated this, more a collection of lots of small things taking up lots of time.
Anyway, todays aim is to make a couple of posts to update whatâ€™s being going on, so lets beginâ€¦

BarCamp London 7
October 27, 2009
Over the weekend a couple of us went down to BarCamp London 7, which was pretty fun. Lots of interesting people and lots of interesting topics.
Hopefully over the course of this week iâ€™ll write a more comprehensive review, so watch this space ðŸ™‚

Some Code
October 27, 2009
I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s been any code published on the blog before, so i thought for a change, Iâ€™d put up what Iâ€™ve been working with this morning.
As weâ€™re working with images, I thought it would be cool to be able to have my image and then perhaps overlay a frame of some kind on top to give the impression (for example) that the image is â€˜stuckâ€™ in a â€˜photo albumâ€™. After a little bit of trial-error-giving-up-and-googling, i came across this blog post which did kind of what I wantedâ€¦ http://www.realdevelopers.com/blog/?p=415
A quick look at the code and it seemed simple enough, so I thought I would convert it to C# for use in MonoTouch. After a small amount of confusion (revolving around the pointer to and allocation of â€˜bitmapDataâ€™) it now works.
Here we goâ€¦ a useful bit of code to composite images in MonoTouchâ€¦
using System;
using System.Drawing;
using MonoTouch.Foundation;
using MonoTouch.UIKit;
using MonoTouch.CoreGraphics;
namespace ImageOverlayRotate
{
public class ImageUtils
{
public ImageUtils ()
{
}
public UIImage overlayImage (UIImage image, UIImage overlay,
RectangleF imageRect, RectangleF overlayRect,
SizeF size)
{
RectangleF imageBoundingBox = imageRect;
RectangleF overlayBoundingBox = overlayRect;
CGBitmapContext context = createBitmapOfSize(size);
context.SetRGBFillColor(1,1,1,1);
context.FillRect(imageBoundingBox);
//context.ClearRect(iconBoundingBox);
context.DrawImage(imageBoundingBox, image.CGImage);
context.DrawImage(overlayBoundingBox,overlay.CGImage);
UIImage result = UIImage.FromImage(context.ToImage());
return result;
}
private CGBitmapContext createBitmapOfSize (SizeF size)
{
CGColorSpace colorspace;
int bitmapBytesPerRow;
bitmapBytesPerRow = (int)(size.Width * 4);
colorspace = CGColorSpace.CreateDeviceRGB ();
CGBitmapContext context = new CGBitmapContext (
IntPtr.Zero,
(int)size.Width,
(int)size.Height,
8,
bitmapBytesPerRow,
colorspace,
CGImageAlphaInfo.PremultipliedLast
);
context.SetAllowsAntialiasing (false);
return context;
}
}
