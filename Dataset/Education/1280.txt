The Business of Open Source
December 19, 2011

“I’ve experienced quite a bit about how open source works. It’s been a wonderful learning experience for me and definitely turned me from someone who thought open source code and developers were somehow not as good as closed source equivalents into a person who knows that the opposite is most definitely the case!”(Mark Little, Red Hat, blog)
Indisputable fact of today’s worlds is an existence of many IT companies that based their success on the Open Source. Talend, Alfresco, Cloudera, Mozilla and last but not least: Red Hat/JBoss (How JBoss did it!) are great examples of that.

OAuth 2.0 Implementation in Python
July 23, 2011
maciejmachulak 1 comment
The SMART team has just released a new OAuth 2.0 implementation in Python. You can find the source code here and the documentation for the library is available here. The library in Python has  been developed entirely by Jacek Szpot (with a little help from the SMART team). Jacek joined SMART around 4 weeks ago and we are very excited about this first release.
The OAuth 2.0 Python library has been released under the Apache 2.0 license and we plan to continue further development. As always, we very much appreciate feedback and we’re open to suggestions on how to make the library better!
