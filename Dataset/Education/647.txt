Inter-institutional Authorisation Management to Support eLearning with reference
to Clinical Teaching
Not dead, just sleeping.... The IAMSECT project was a 2-year collaboration between the universities of
Durham, Newcastle and Northumbria working on developing, testing and disseminating
a practical approach to the problems of authentication and authorisation management
utilising Shibboleth. The project, which was funded under the JISC Core Middleware Development
Programme, has now concluded. We hope to make all remaining deliverables available
by the end of July 06. The first draft of the project final report
is available; this will be updated during the coming weeks.
