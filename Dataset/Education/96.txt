Welcome to the AARDVARK Project. The Aardvark project is part of the JISC Building Capacity programme which has a focus on creating strategic changes.
Our project is building on the tools and experiences available from existing University of Bedfordshire projects as well as JISC funded ones.
The project team is composed from members of the Research Graduate School and the Teaching and Learning
Directorate. Our objectives are to explore uses of technology to develop and formalise the operation of research degree programmes, better support the researcher experience and effectively capture and record the research process. In order to achieve our objectives, we aim to:
Develop BREO, the University’s virtual learning environment, as a better resource for researchers, their supervisors and the Research Graduate School. Explore the use of PebblePad, an e-portfolio platform, for researcher-supervisor interactions. Raise the profile of JISC events, services, funding opportunities and projects throughout the University of Bedfordshire.Investigate improved ways to aid the completion of research projects.   The AARDVARK project is part of the JISC funded Building Capacity programme.
