Welcome to the cairo website!
Cairo will develop a tool for ingesting complex collections of born-digital materials, with basic descriptive, preservation and relationship metadata, into a preservation repository. The project is based on needs identified by the JISC-funded Paradigm project and the Wellcome Library's Digital Curation in Action project. It is a key building block in the partner institutions' strategy to develop digital repository architectures which can support the development of digital collections over the long-term.
