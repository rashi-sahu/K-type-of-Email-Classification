The good, the bad and the good or bad: Haringey, Coventry, Dudley, Liverpool and Wolverhampton
Feb 19th
Posted by Ian Anstice in Uncategorized
No comments
Editorial
A mixture of the good and bad. Haringey have overturned previously reported plans to cut library opening hours and are instead investing £2 million in them instead. That’s quite some U-turn. From the news report I read, it seems like they did an honest consultation (hi Livewire, see it can be done) and the result was taken on board. It’s also good to see Coventry also having a rethink and reducing the cuts there, although four libraries are still to become volunteer, which is hardly nothing.  It’s interesting to see GLL taking over another library service (that’s four so far I think) in Dudley.  The leisure trust has now completely overcome its London roots and must be seen as a force to be reckoned with nationally.  Whether that’s good or bad, depends on how you feel about non-profit trusts. On the bad side, Liverpool are cutting the libraries budget by nearly £2 million and trying to pass on four libraries to others and Wolverhampton are going for full-on co-locations and volunteers. Expect a lot more from those two councils in PLN soon.
Changes
Coventry – Cuts reduced for one year: 4 libraries still to become volunteer.
Dudley – GLL to take over new libraries/archives mutual for at least five years.
Haringey – £2m investment in libraries: previous suggestion to cut hours reversed.
Liverpool – £1.8m cut proposed for 2018/19. 4 libraries under threat. Volunteers to be increased.
Wolverhampton – Review. Bilston Library could close/relocate to town hall. Low Hill may close/relocate to community centre. East Park may close/ relocate elsewhere. Businesses to be asked to rent space in Finchfield, Whitmore Reans, Spring Vale and Penn. Volunteers may staff 8 libraries (Finchfield, Pendeford, Penn, Spring Vale, East Park, Tettenhall, Wednesfield, Whitmore Reans), Warstones may close and become part of new co-located community centre. Open+ may be used.

Local news by authority
Brent – Kensal Rise newsletter – Kensal Rise Library. Author event with Alan Johnson MP, report on refurbishment, £40k still needed but “The library’s refurbishment is only possible due to our remarkable achievement of raising £160,000 before the deadlines we set ourselves in 2016. All the hard work has paid off and we are grateful for the success of our application for £75,000 to Power To Change and our other awards from the Foyle Foundation, The Garfield Weston Foundation and Brent Council, plus sponsorship from Daniels Estate Agents, an anonymous bequest of £10,000, revenue from our ever popular events – and not least, the generous support of the community.”
Buckinghamshire – Our 10 Year Story – Little Chalfont Community Library. ” 2006 Buckinghamshire County Council announced the proposed closure of a number of branch libraries, including Little Chalfont.  This was massively opposed by the residents of Little Chalfont who convinced the council that it could be kept open and run by the community at no cost to the Council. The library has now been run as a charity, raising its own funding and staffed entirely by volunteers (the only person who gets paid is the window cleaner) for 10 years. It has gone from strength to strength and by clicking the tabs below, you can see the progress we have made. Of course, none of this could have happened without the continued and generous support from readers, local businesses, council grants and residents. Little Chalfont has much to thank you for.

Coventry – Coventry libraries to stay open another year as £2.4m council cuts announced – Coventry Telegraph. “Plans to close libraries have been stalled for another year as Coventry City Council announces £2.4m worth of cuts to services that help the city’s most vulnerable. While libraries have been saved for now, funding for youth services and dozens of full-time jobs will be axed if proposals for youth services, children’s centres and libraries are approved on March 7. Around 85 jobs, mostly in children’s centres, are likely to go – but council bosses have pledged to help affected staff by offering early retirement, voluntary redundancy or training options. After the closure of Arena Park library and its relocation to Holbrooks Community Centre, the council has given its reassurance that no other libraries will close for the next 12 months.”
Devon – Date set for sneak preview of new East Devon library – Exeter Express and Echo. “While some communities have lost the libraries, Ottery St Mary is bucking the trend by opening one in the town, and residents are being invited to enjoy a sneak preview inside it. What was previously the NatWest Bank building in the centre of the town has been turned into the first library to be opened by Libraries Unlimited. The new staff and community-owned social enterprise was established last spring with the support of Devon County Council. Its doors will briefly open on Friday, February 24, between 4.30pm and 6pm, for a first-look at its transformation. It will then officially open for business the following day from 10am.”
Dudley – Exciting times for library mutual – Dudley Council. “Following a competitive process, Greenwich Leisure Limited (GLL) has been chosen as the preferred partner to bring their expertise to Dudley libraries and archives and run our mutual over the next five years. GLL is a charitable social enterprise which is committed to working on behalf of the whole community.  As an employee led mutual it involves staff in decisions about its services.  It has been running leisure and library services since 1993 and currently manages libraries in Wandsworth and Lincolnshire as well as Greenwich Council’s library services. “
Haringey – Average household council tax bills in Haringey set to rise by £39 – Enfield Gazette and Advertiser. ““We’ve listened closely to what local people have told us, which is why our proposals include a commitment to maintaining current opening hours at our libraries and investment in further library improvements, alongside funding for roads, pavements and leisure,” he added.” £2million investment in libraries, shelving an earlier suggestion to reduce opening hours.
Lancashire – Aussie trio bring ‘aural treat’ to latest library music session – Visitor. “Stewart Parsons, from Get It Loud in Libraries (GILIL), said: “Loud In Libraries is delighted to have booked such a hot band for its spiritual home – Lancaster Library. “Only a few remaining tickets are left on sale and the city’s music lovers are in for an aural treat.””
Lewisham – This man is saving London’s ailing libraries from closure – Big Issue. “The Big Issue Group’s social investment arm, helped Eco Communities access finance to transform libraries, cherished public resources, in deprived parts of south London. “Eco Communities is actually run out of my local library in Crofton Park,” says Daniel Wilson-Dodd, head of lending at Big Issue Invest. “The library is helping more people to access knowledge and opportun-ities, as well as a good cup of coffee. It’s also used by lots of different people, from the very young to the very old, across a range of socio-economic backgrounds. It’s great to see the impact of our investment in person.”” … “p and down the UK, social enterprises like Eco Communities have proved themselves shrewd and flexible operators, finding new revenue streams by opening up library spaces to a wider range of outside partners, from housing associations to Citizens Advice bureaus to further education providers.”
Liverpool – Budget 2017: 300 jobs to go, 5% council tax rise and libraries under threat – Liverpool Echo. Four libraries under threat for 2019. £1.6m cut proposed for 2018/19. Volunteers may be involved.
North Somerset – Nailsea library and college could be sold if services move to Scotch Horn – North Somerset Times.
North Yorkshire – Town’s cash gift to help library rescue group – Northern Echo. “Town council is handing over £4,000 of taxpayers money to help save the community’s threatened library. Bedale town councillors agreed unanimously to contribute the money requested by volunteers setting up the new community library. They are taking over the running of the library after funding for staff was scrapped by North Yorkshire county council in the face of massive budget cuts. Neighbouring parish councils are also giving money, Aiskew and Leeming Bar £2,000 and Crakehall £500, with further amounts from other villages.”
Northamptonshire – ‘Work in libraries’ Northamptonshire council staff told – BBC. “Staff at a county council have been told to work either in a library or from home because work to their new headquarters has been delayed. Northamptonshire County Council’s current HQ has been sold. Workers, including social workers, must move out by the end of March but cannot move into the new Angel Square complex in Northampton until a month later. Unison said it was concerned there could be confidentiality issues with staff updating files in libraries.”
South Tyneside – The Word welcomes 88,000 visitors in first two months – Shields Gazette. “The Word – National Centre for the Written Word – welcomed 88,000 visitors in its first two months of operation. Meanwhile, the centre’s website attracted almost 40,000 visits, and 867 new readers joined the library since October – an increase of nearly 400% compared to the same period in the old Central Library.More than 50,000 people have now visited the Ridley Scott exhibition, which was endorsed by the man himself. Sir Ridley said he was ‘proud and humbled’ to be honoured with the exhibition in his home ” [Included here as I think I missed this December article at the time – Ed.]
Oxfordshire – Heralding the Past column by Jackie Smith: A history of Abingdon’s libraries – Oxford Mail.
Warrington – Trust is lost – Warrington Guardian / Letters. “new report into libraries appears to propose a collection of ad hoc arrangements cobbled together in the face of the public outrage at LiveWire’s closure programme. Let’s not be gulled into believing that the brief details are anything other than the usual soothing noises about possibilities here and there. It’s typical of LiveWire to peddle such stuff in its hurry to distract from its own inability to manage our library service, which is disintegrating before our eyes. Our councillors should treat the cause not the symptoms”
Wolverhampton – Wolverhampton libraries: Bilston could move from 145-year-old home in major shake-up – Express and Star. “A major shake-up of libraries in Wolverhampton has been unveiled with one facing a move from its 145-year-old home and businesses being invited in to four others.” … “The city council has launched a review over its 16 libraries. Bilston library could be relocated from its Grade II listed home in Mount Pleasant to Bilston Town Hall under one proposal put forward. Central library in Wolverhampton will remain with improvements planned inside the building. Other ideas include relocating Low Hill library to Low Hill Community Hub and East Park to an unknown location.”
The public can be such banes to council plans

Editorial
Councils in Bath & North East Somerset (“BANES”) and Warrington have both needed to accommodate to public anger at plans to cut library services this week. The concessions may be more apparent than real – BANES are simply going to do a consultation on moving Central into a co-location away from the town centre (and with half the space) rather than a fait accompli.  Of course, seasoned readers of PLN will know the likelihood of a council actually changing its plans after a consultation in anything but in the mildest terms in order to show they listened but, with anger pretty high in the spa town, which is hardly a normal area of mass political dissent, it’s a step in the right direction. Warrington council, while supporting the initial (in my view highly flawed and biased) consultation are creating a group to see how they can best keep libraries open.  Again, PLN readers will suspect this will simply boil down to “volunteer or we’ll close it” but I am sure we all hope to stand corrected soon.
Meanwhile, the Taskforce have produced two posts on mutualising library services. With austerity now in its seventh (eighth?) year, this is seen as one of the best ways of maintaining library services along with volunteers, co-locations, increased use of volunteers and (increasingly) pressuring parish/borough councils to stump up cash instead.  To their credit, the Taskforce do not present any of these options as a panacea. Which is just as well: those councils which make cuts to libraries often find out the items on the efficiencies/savings/cuts menu can be unpalatable when presented to the public. But then it’s the same public so often who voted for austerity in the first place.

Libraries offer futures: and the Big Issue is for the future of libraries
Feb 14th

Editorial
A noticeably quiet couple of days with the main thing being to me two pro library campaigns, both of which are not just local over closures.  It’s good to see the CILIPS Library Matters campaign picking up some strength in Scotland before the election there, with another celebrity author on board. A very pleasant surprise was the Big Issue campaign that has just launched.  It’s worth a look as it says very nice things about libraries and John Bird, now a Lord, is clearly a powerful ally. Across the water, public librarians are now turning their sense of shock over President Trump’s presidency into action. It’s going to be a tough tightrope for them.  Although the political position of libraries are different there (they’re often not under direct council control whereas anyone employed in libraries getting political in the UK in working hours would presumably just plain be disciplined or dismissed) they still have to presumably be neutral.  The challenge is going to be how to balance the political desire to act with the expectation that librarians remain unbiased.  I simple don’t know how that will turn out in these strange times in America.

Political games, not standing still … and waving placards
Feb 12th

Editorial
There’s a couple of examples of libraries being used as pawns in political games before local elections in May today, with opposition parties scaremongering and the party in power (often the same party as in opposition doing the same thing elsewhere) crying foul.  Libraries have never really hit the headlines in the media before elections and I’m curious to see if such mentions increase or quiet down.  In terms of actual news, I’m sorry to see that West Berkshire have confirmed a big budget cut, although they’re avoiding closing libraries by relying on volunteers and parish council handouts.  That’s bad news for the staff (which will be reduced by half) but good news for the libraries minister who had been called on to intervene if the council actually closed many,  On the other hand, good news in Torfaen where Unison are claiming a major victory in repealing a £240k cut.  The union has done some notably good work in South Wales, although it has been notably less active nationally in the sector. Meanwhile in parliament, the libraries minister received two friendly questions from MPs of his own party, re-emphasising once more his view that “standing still is not really an option”.  Which, it seems, is true – as people enthusiastically waving placards in Bath, Darlington, Lambeth, Plymouth, North East Lincolnshire, Walsall and elsewhere show.
Changes
Cambridgeshire – Cambridge Central Library £65k refurbishment of children’s library.
Dorset – Libraries may be co-located with job/health/daycare centre in six trial locations.
Leicestershire – Quorn volunteer library opens, in Academy with parish council backing, 13 hours per week.
Northeast Lincolnshire – Cleethorpes Library to close, services co-located to tourist information centre.
Swansea – 3 libraries (inc. Brynhyfryd) alleged to be under threat by opposition councillors.
Torfaen – Proposed £240k cut repealed.
West Berkshire – £580k cut confirmed: paid staffing budget to be halved.

Wales, E-resources and co-located Gymbraries
Feb 7th
Posted by Ian Anstice in Uncategorized
No comments
The BBC has produced a large survey of the state of play in Welsh public libraries.  It makes interesting reading, with the excellent work being done nationally (on, for example, e-resources) being at least counterbalanced by the effect of cuts on local library services. Library e-resources are looked at in a guest post hosted by the Libraries Taskforce which points out that too often excellent resources are hidden behind inadequate, or even downright obstructive, council websites.
There’s a bit of other news as well but I will continue the thread on the damaging of library unique selling points started in the last post by just mentioning co-locations.  As with supplier stock selecting (and it was rightly pointed out to me – thanks Jane –  that if expert librarians work with the supplier very well, it’s not a bad thing, the problem is when they don’t or when there aren’t any librarians any more), co-locations can be really good. The right co-location can attract traffic into the library and not detract from the neutral and welcoming atmosphere that is a key library USP.
The downside, though, is where the co-location is forced upon the library and services which detract from such an atmosphere become uneasy bedfellows.  These bad co-locations can damage the neutrality of the library, especially when the service is poorly understood by those in the driving seat.  A probable “bad” co-location is up for grabs as I’m writing this with the imminent decision on combining gyms and libraries in Lambeth.  This has been the source of much anger and parody, which is a shame as the instigators (GLL) have done good work with libraries from what I have seen elsewhere.  If the combination (I’ve seen it called a “gymbrary”) does go ahead, let’s see how neutral and welcoming it is to library users.  I hope my fears on the subject are proved wrong.
Changes
Birmingham – Kents Moat Library to close, Aston Library saved from closure, Sutton Coldfield to stay open until at least end of August.

Waterstone’s recovery hints at what libraries should do
Feb 5th
Posted by Ian Anstice in Uncategorized
5 comments
Editorial
Two conflicting stories this post. One is the story of libraries facing a big cut in usage over ten years, which I’ve covered in previous posts. The other is how Waterstones has made a dramatic comeback.  Now, Waterstones and public libraries are very different to each other – even Daunt could not have coped with the cuts some libraries are being forced to take and would probably have been driven to madness by council bureaucracy – but there are things that libraries can learn from him.  This is that local control over bookstock is important. You need to have experts choosing for particular libraries to match the needs of local communities.
Driven by budget cuts, many library authorities have forgotten the need for tailored local stock and farmed out book purchasing to large library suppliers. While (very importantly) saving on staff time and cost, this necessarily means a loss of that local connection and, also, a downgrading of the librarian role, with often the loss of professionals who have spent decades learning what goes best where. Sadly, thus is lost one of the many unique selling points (USPs)  that a public library once had, and some still have, that have been lost in the drive for efficiency.  I’ll be coming back to other disappearing USPs in future posts – councils appear in some ways to have spent decades removing them – but for the moment it’s great to see Waterstones rediscovering theirs, not least because I love bookshops more than any other high street outlet. Well, except libraries of course.

USA and Canada see library usage rise: 3/4 budget cuts in Walsall and Kirklees
Jan 31st
Posted by Ian Anstice in Uncategorized
No comments
Editorial
Those people who say the decline in public libraries are inevitable should look at what is happening in the USA and Canada some time. Just today, there are stories that show that library visits (even book issues) in the USA are increasing long-term and the big authority of Hamilton in Canada saw an increase of 13% over one year. Neither the USA overall or Hamilton have seen deep cuts to their budgets. How that’s going to change with Trump as President one can sadly guess at but the figures show that the decline in UK library usage is not pre-ordained. If you think it is, explain why it’s not happening there.  Sadly, however, why the cuts are happening here is pretty evident. From just today’s announcements – Kirklees will soon have reduced their libraries budget by 72% by my reckoning (check the figures below) and Walsall are reported as cutting their budget from £4m to £1m, another cut of three-quarters. Meanwhile, West Berkshire are proudly announcing that they won’t close as many libraries as they originally wanted to because they’re going to depend on volunteers and parish/town council donations instead. Faced with such cuts, it’s pretty clear the decline in Britain is more a case of Austerity killing them than anything else.
Changes
Cornwall – Bodmin Library moves to co-located council offices: longer hours.
Devon – Ottery St Mary Library to relocate to improved (ex-bank) building, with assistance from town council and Friends.
Kirklees – £1.7m cut to budget 2017/18 (from £3.9m to £2.2m) : £1.85m cuts from start 2016 to end 2018. This is on top of last cut of £1.8m cut in 2015/16 (when budget was presumably £5.7m) meaning budget cut by 72% cut in three years.
North Yorkshire – £3.5m cut since 2010.
Walsall – £3m cut (from previous figure £4m: 75% cut):  9 libraries to close (Beechdale, Blakenall, New Invention, Pelsall, Pleck, Pheasey, Rushall, South Walsall and Walsall South). Previously, up to 15 (out of 16) threatened.
West Berkshire – Library closures threatened reduced to 1 library (Wash Common) and 1 mobile: staff to be largely replaced with volunteers in other threatened libraries, with all parish/town councils asked for £1 donation per resident.

I’m going to be trying out a new feature for a while – making  a note each post of those library authorities under the most media scrutiny.  This will be done making use of the map of the UK which has been on the right hand side of the website for some time now.  Made by a clever coder, this map links every “Local News By Authority” mention I make and puts them in the correct place on the United Kingdom (expect for the Isle of Man which, for some reason, ends up in Lancashire – go figure).  Because every link is attached to a dot, differently coloured due to the number of media mentions, it’s easy to spot the areas under the most scrutiny.  It’s worth pointing out that such mentions may theoretically be for positive reasons as well as for negative ones but I’ll keep an eye out for those and mention them if they occur. They haven’t done so yet.
So, for the first one, the red “danger” areas are Lancashire, with a massive 27 mentions reflecting the sheer number of branches being cut there, and Plymouth with 13.  In the still-scary orange dot category are Bath and North East Somerset, Birmingham, Darlington, Swindon, Warrington and (seemingly everpresent) North Yorkshire. I hope that by doing this I’m hoping this will give the reader an at-a-glance heatmap of the state of UK public libraries.  We’ll see how it goes.

This applies to relationships within families as much as other social groups” [There is a survey you can take part in.  I found it, though, quite obtrusive when I completed it, as it demands your personal contact details right at the start, with no explanation as to why.  You can put false information in the fields easily if you would prefer anonymity.

Canada – Arnprior’s librarian named Public Librarian of the Year by the Ontario Library Association – Inside Ottawa Valley. “One of her major achievements has been the launch of the iPod Project, where the library partnered with the Grove Nursing home to provide its residents with iPods and personalized playlists. ” … “The library raised nearly $4,000 to purchase 60 iPods and the music for the individual playlists”

USA – Library Cats Leave Some Sneezing, Others Feline Fine – American Libraries. “Though everything turned out all right for the lucky kitty, the incident illustrated just how contentious having a cat in a library can be, even when the cat is popular with patrons. Perhaps that’s why the number of library cats in the United States has declined drastically in recent decades.” … “In an attempt to minimize the allergens present on library materials, staff members swipe each book with a Clorox wipe. Still, Sharp knows patron allergies are an ever-present concern.” … “Before adopting Stacks in 2009, Zumwalt consulted local veterinarians about allergies. “They said that as long as we kept the hair vacuumed, we really shouldn’t have any problems,” ” … “Frannie Shue, Centre County library director, is a big fan of “Saturday Caturday,” saying, “It’s a nice alternative for libraries that do not have cats—but love cats as much as books.””
USA – Mirrors and Windows: Diversity in Children’s Picture Books – Public LIbraries Online. “Working for an inner-city library, I am very conscious about choosing books that reflect what my storytime children look like and the culture to which they can relate. When searching for non-white main characters in picture books, I find it is much more dif­ficult than it ought to be.” … “Books are windows, but also mirrors. We often can relate to most any story in some way, however, if we cannot connect to the illustrations that do not mirror us, we will become apathetic to stories.”
Local news by authority
Barnet – Job Opportunity: Library Manager based in Barnet – Inclusion Barnet. “We are a voluntary organisation in Barnet, North London and we are about to take over the running of two branch libraries as community-based ‘partnership libraries’, working with the London Borough of Barnet.” … “we can offer an attractive salary, a positive and inclusive working environment and a warm and supportive team around you, including a CEO with a background in library management”
Bradford – Volunteers urgently needed to help run Thornbury library – Telegraph and Argus. “Unless more volunteers respond to an appeal soon to help keep Thornbury Library open, it will close on April 1. Bradford Council announced in February last year that the branch based in the Thornbury Centre in Leeds Old Road would be one of fourteen libraries across the district to shut unless local communities could find enough helpers to staff them. But the take-up at Thornbury Library has been “a bit slow so far” according to parish priest and chairman of the Thornbury Centre, Father Nicholas Clews.”
Darlington – Crucial vote delayed again as Tory councillors force deferral in the battle to save Darlington’s Crown Street Library – Northern Echo. “The proposals would see the town’s mobile library service axed, Cockerton Library given over to volunteers and the historic Crown Street library closed, with the majority of its resources to be transferred to the Dolphin Centre” … “In an unexpected move, opposition councillors have provided the much-loved library with a last minute stay of execution by demanding further scrutiny of Darlington Borough Council’s long-opposed proposals. Responding to concerns repeatedly raised by campaigners, Conservative councillors have ‘called in’ the agenda item concerning library services ahead of Thursday’s final vote on the issue.” see Library Call-In – Darlington Council and Forward Plan – Darlington Council.
Hounslow – Library to re-open partially after two month closure following ceiling collapse – Get West London. “Part of Brentford library will reopen this weekend more than two months after the ceiling collapsed. The Grade II listed building on Boston Manor Road has been closed since November 10, last year, after the plaster from one of the ceilings in the children’s section fell overnight.” … “However the children’s section will remain closed until works are completed with the aim of fully re-opening on March 11″
Leeds – Chief Librarian – Leeds Council. “Leeds City Council is delivering an ambitious programme of more locally determined and integrated services which help ensure that all who live, visit and work in the city have access to quality public services. As part of this development, an exciting opportunity has arisen to lead and develop the Library and Information service across the city, an integral part of our proposition to deliver more integrated and accessible services.  ”

Plymouth – Anthologia: Library Closure Special  – Tall Tales. “In response to the local library cuts suggested in Plymouth this week, several local writers have banded together to form ‘The Library Party’. This group has the aim of raising awareness of the proposed cuts and helping the public voice their concern and objections to the closures. This special Anthologia has poetry and micro-fiction from local Plymouth writers. Each piece focuses on the issue, libraries or the essential service provided by this ancient institution. There are also images explaining what is proposed and links to the petition within this page. “
Plymouth – Council told libraries are ‘community hubs’ at first public meeting over closures – Herald. “Jennifer Pointer, a mother of two, who attended the meeting with her family, felt that the closure of the school’s library would be wrong as for her libraries are “a life-line”. “I had quite bad post natal depression,” said Mrs Pointer, “The library was a good way to meet other mums and talk about it – they are a bit of a life-line.”. Many responses ask for investment in libraries to improve them rather than closing them.
Swindon – Libraries minister comes to Swindon as community deadline looms – Swindon Advertiser. “Last month Coun Mary Martin met with MP Rob Wilson, whose ministerial portfolio includes libraries, and on Thursday he came to Swindon to take a closer look at the plans” … “As part of the visit, he was shown the central library as well as Covingham library, which is well-advanced in its set up as a community run facility.” Covingham is one of the few community libraries where a clear path to a secure future has emerged. A trust model, devised by ward councillors and recently registered with the charities commission, has received the backing of local library supporters and the borough council” … “”It was a productive meeting to give the minister an update on the work that is going on towards protecting our vital libraries and to discuss further options for where the government can provide assistance. “I’m greatly encouraged, we seem to be making good progress.”
Campaigning for libraries before they’re under threat

A quiet couple of days when it comes to library news and, actually, I quite like that.  I’m tracking quite a lot of protest though.  Here’s some examples. In Plymouth, there’s a large amount of love being expressed for the threatened libraries there – I’ve just been speaking to a journalist there who was if anything unhappier than I am about cuts to libraries.  Warrington has not gone entirely quiet either – there’s some concern that news that all libraries have been saved there is not quite what it seems.  Finally, the good people of Darlington are getting really quite upset about the projected loss of their central library. So, there’s all this energy for libraries but it’s all after the cuts happen.  But i many ways that’s too late. What we need is preparation beforehand and enough support that councils don’t reach for the axe so much in the first place.  It’s therefore great to see the advocacy/campaigning and lobbying being discussed by EveryLIbrary in the USA. Closer to home, I’m delighted to see a very timely post from Irvine Welsh about Scottish libraries (in good time for their elections) and also a new chair, ex-librarian Sheffield MP Gill Furniss for the All-Party Parliamentary Group for libraries.  It seem we are learning, slowly and painfully, that placards are not as good as avoiding  the need for protest in the first place.

The Minister for Libraries speaks
Jan 24th

Editorial
I’ve heard rumours about the new libraries minister, Rob Wilson, for a while now.  Some suggest his ardent pro-volunteer bodes ill for libraries and others earnestly hoped that he would be an interventionist. Rumours that reached my ears about his speeches at the Ambition sessions held by the Task Force included suggestions he wanted large-scale closures. It turns out he’s not as extreme as all this suggests: well, not for a Conservative minister anyway.
Unlike his predecessor, the ever-optimistic (and sometimes possibly wilfully blind) Ed Vaizey, he’s openly acknowledging that there are problems. He repeats (like Ed Vaizey) that he will look into library closures but (unlike Ed, in office anyway) has actually taken an active interest in visiting an authority where deep closures are taking place. Don’t get too excited, though – Lancashire are still happily transferring libraries even after his visit so they must strongly suspect he’s not actually going to do anything.
He’s also keen on initiatives and ways to lessen the impact of the cuts, even suggesting (as so many do) that somehow, given the right management and genius thinking, libraries will be fine. Someone should show him the deal in the Isle of Man where an online  gambling company is financially supporting the mobile library service, taking over from another one. Taking advantage of low-taxed gambling companies to keep libraries open? Now that’s innovative.  So, having seen the last few months and read the speech by  Rob Wilson, my verdict he is not Satan but he’s no St George either. Libraries remain as wonderful and as under threat as ever and need to find our own solutions, without the strong shield of government.  Well, no-one can say we’re not used to that.
Changes
Isle of Man – Microgaming, a private company, supports mobile library for next three years. Mobile Library previously supported by PokerStars.
Lancashire – Penwortham Library passed to town council / volunteers.
Milton Keynes – Various cuts including introduction of supplier selection, increased co-location and room hire, more Open+ equivalent, bookfung cut, ceasing of interlending.
