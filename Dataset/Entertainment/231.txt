I'M STARTING the year full of fresh ideas for books but I also thought that I'd try out a blog format for Wild West Yorkshire. Please be patient as it's going to take some time to make the format feel as if it's my own as I've started with an off-the-shelf WordPress scheme. You can find my new blog-style nature diary at:

Note about the mailing list: I'll e-mail no more than once a week about new pages that I've added to the diary. The updates go out as 'blind carbon copies' so there shouldn't be any chance of the list finding its way to a third party. I certainly won't pass on any addresses to anybody.
