Welcome to the Rutland Osprey Project
Rutland Water is home to the first Ospreys to breed in England for 150 years, after a translocation programme. We observe them from their arrival from Africa in Spring, through to their Autumn migration. Come and join us at Rutland Water Nature Reserve to learn more about these magnificent birds!
