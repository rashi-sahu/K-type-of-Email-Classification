The Olympic Flame will be borne by around 500 runners along more than 300 streets during its five-day tour of Wales. It will arrive in Monmouth on May 25, six days after the relay starts in Lands End, before being carried through South and West Wales, up Cardigan Bay and across North Wales, leaving Welshpool on May 30. The torch will stop overnight at Cardiff, Swansea, Aberystwyth and Bangor before the bearers run across North Wales to spend the night in Chester on 29 May.
Among the runners is the 74-year-old long-time community athletics organiser John Collins from Swansea . Other community workers across Wales are among those who have been chosen to carry the torch.
A free 16,000-ticket concert, Move to the Beat, will be held in Cardiff's Coopers Field on Friday, May 25, while Swansea, Aberystwyth and Bangor are all planning events. Highlights of the relay in Wales include a trip to the summit of Snowdon on the Snowdon Mountain Railway and a ride on the land train along the Promenade at Mumbles. It will be carried up the cliff railway in Aberystwyth and by steam train between Blaenau Ffestiniog and Porthmadog. The torch will also be carried on the back of a Ceredigion cob horse in Aberaeron and on a lifeboat between Beaumaris and Menai Bridge. On its last day in Wales the torch will be carried on a hand-drawn boat across the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct, near Wrexham. Organisers hope the 8,000-mile UK-wide relay involving 8,000 torchbearers will be the point when enthusiasm for the Games ignites across the country. An average of 115 torchbearers a day will carry the flame during the nationwide relay, from May 19 to July 27, to the opening ceremony in Stratford, east London. Details on the two-day finale to the 70-day relay, which brings the Olympic Flame to the lighting of the cauldron to start the Games, are being kept under wraps until closer to the start of the relay at Lands End on May 19. High-flying activities await some torchbearers as the flame will abseil down the Dock Tower at Grimsby and swoop off the Tyne Bridge in Newcastle Gateshead on a zip wire. Restoration work to the Flying Scotsman means that the Scots Guardsman train will now take the flame on its journey between York and Thirsk. It will also be taken on a skywalk at Croke Park as it visits Dublin on June 6 in its only stop outside of the UK. The overall route has been designed to also take in cultural institutions such as the Turner Gallery in Margate and Cass Sculpture Park at Goodwood as well as many of sporting stadia and racecourses. London 2012 chairman Lord Coe said: The flame symbolises the Olympic spirit and its journey around the UK will bring the excitement of the Games to our streets. Now the people know the route the Olympic Flame will be carried along and the torchbearers for their community, they can start planning how they might celebrate.
