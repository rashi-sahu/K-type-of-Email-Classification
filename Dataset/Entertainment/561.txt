Option Trading: My Caramel Macchiato to your Black Coffee - Equities.com Global Financial Community When you think about it, it's amazing that Starbucks is still a thing. There were a lot of old timey coffee drinkers that scoffed at a company that said they would build a business around the concept of making coffee cool. These naysayers also did not think it was possible to sell a thirty-five cent Cup-O-Joe for upwards of $5.00 per cup. Regardless of what you might have thought about Starbucks 30 years ago, you cant argue with the fact that five stock splits later, the companys shares are closing in on the $90.00 mark. The marketing pros at Starbucks were able to create an entirely new demographic of coffee drinkers. I have to admit, I was part of that new demographic. I hated coffee; that is, until I was introduced to a Caramel Macchiato. After my first CM (hip lingo for my new favorite drink!), I would stay up late at night trying to memorize that a grande was not a view website large, and tall really means small, so I did not sound like a rookie to the coolest people on the planet - the baristas. The baristas have the power to make coffee taste really good by doing really creative things to really bitter stuff. I Like My Coffee Like I Like My Equity Options When I was younger, I used to think of stock trading the same way that I thought of black coffee: kind of bitter and boring. I knew that people traded stocks, but I really wasn't interested in joining them. Even when commissions became really cheap, I still was not interested. It still seemed like a game for stuffy, rich people. I did not consider myself to be either one. http://www.equities.com/editors-desk/options/option-trading-my-caramel-macchiato-to-your-black-coffee Home - Equities.com Global Financial Community Top News Jeff Kagan / Technology The new curved TV appears to offer nothing new... except its own newness.
