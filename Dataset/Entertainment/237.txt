Protect the Superstars of our Coast!
Our Fylde Sand Dunes project is carrying out crucial work to raise awareness of the dunes and their wildlife.
This past week we've been planting used Christmas Trees, in orderÂ to provide a crucial defence against sand and sea. In addition we have a series of FREE guided walks around Lytham St Annes LNR where you can experience the magic of the dunes. Find out more here.
