Welcome!
This website celebrates Stoke Mandeville's role as the birthplace of the Paralympic movement.
The site tells the story of Sir Ludwig Guttmann at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, who revolutionised  treatment and life chances for those with spinal injuries. He organised the first ‘Stoke Mandeville Games’; the forerunner of today's Paralympic Games to coincide with the start of the London Olympics in 1948.
We have celebrated this legacy through a range of activities involving past and present Paralympians, disabled artists, school children, young people and local residents.
Work continues on the project and we continue to add to this website, so please keep coming back for more information.
