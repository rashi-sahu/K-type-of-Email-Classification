Recycling & Waste
Did you know that waste generated as a result of refurbishing a property for a tenant or to re-let between tenancies is classed as commercial waste?
Waste generated during the course of a commercial activity (such as letting a property) is classed as trade or commercial waste and can neither be recycled, nor disposed of, using the recycling and waste services provided to households. Neither can the Household Waste Recycling Centres be used as this would be in breach of the site license and may be an offence in itself.
Therefore any waste generated preparing a property for a new tenant, or waste left behind by previous tenant’s which have moved out, needs to be recycled or disposed of by the landlord using a commercial waste arrangement.
If you are a landlord requiring a commercial waste collection then a range of contractors providing commercial recycling or waste collections can be found in telephone directories under ‘Waste Management’ or ‘Recycling’.
For further information regarding your legal responsibilities and Duty of Care please see our commercial waste pages.
