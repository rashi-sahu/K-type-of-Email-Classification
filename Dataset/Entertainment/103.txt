Introduced
species in the British Isles
WEB
DESIGN BY
SPEEDYSITE
This
website is intended to bring together information on the various flora
and fauna of the British isles that have been introduced, whether by
accident or design, since the year 1700. Introduced species are also
known as exotics, aliens, non indigenous, non - natives, invasives and
a host of other terms. My definition of an introduced species is one
that has survived for at least two generations in Britain in an uncontrolled
(wild) manner after its initial introduction.
Although
mammals and plants are the best known of the introduced species there
are many others, ranging from fish and crustaceans to amphibians and
fungi.
I
have tried to include as many species as possible, however I have not
included anything that cannot be seen with the naked eye due to the
sheer amount of work that would involve.
This
site will always be a work in progress!
Currently 93 species listed on this
