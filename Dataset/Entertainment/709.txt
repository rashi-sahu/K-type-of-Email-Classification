Solar energy – the most popular energy source
Over 60,000 Active Solar Heating systems are estimated to be currently in use in houses in the UK and its growing, being clean, permanent, available in limitless quantities and allowing for independence from rising energy prices. There is also an important social component to solar energy, because it helps provide for a better future for our children and grandchildren and reduces worldwide dependence on limited oil resources.
Generating and using heat locally – Solar thermal for your home
For private homes, generating heat through solar energy is the most sensible solution from a self-sufficiency point of view. Energy for hot water and heating is generated locally from your roof, without transport costs. The system is dimensioned according to your hot water requirements and is determined mainly by the number of collectors on the roof and the size of the storage cylinder.
