Actually this was 3 weeks ago so all the blossom and hawthorne flowers have gone now.A spring Chicken.The Lesney factory , nearly all gone nowHackney wick. Not much new graffiti since the Olympic cleanup began but there are a few bits here and there.Its a Hip Hop rodent.

Yes , absolutely.Matchbox factory is nearly gone.Olympic stadium. Things I saw but couldn't photograph because of my quite rubbish camera - 2 Chinook helicopters , a green woodpecker, 2 magpies (joy) and I smelt the indescribably lovely smell of the bagel factory baking.

A little run down to the City to get some new trainers . Poor lady Gaga she's not that bad is she? She is after all just a singer. You could find a lot of people much more worthy of your ire I'm positive.Down the Kingsland road.Tower 42 disappearing into the clouds.New bridge over the canal for the tube line going into Dalston.Quite jazzy I think.And here's a quick one for anyone even considering voting for this man who unsurprisingly today promised to be brazenly elitist..what really? A toff from Eton being brazenly elitist? Never.

4 mile slush run. I am fed up of getting soggy feet now.Next. Came off the canal at Hackney wick and ran back thorugh the streets as it was less slippy. This is on the wall of an old warehouse where there are a few galleries and artists' studios.There is not much else around here now apart from the interest the artists bring.A few years ago if you went down Carpenters Road on a Sunday all you could hear was the very loud worship from The Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries or the last blast of a rave dying out from the night before. The only other people around were monged out clubbers and blissed out churchgoers.I spose they all looked a bit like this but with crazy clothing. Giant headwraps for the religious ladies and that minging cyber/hippie/punk look with those nasty platform shoes for the mongers.A view over the canal to the new flats that are part of the new ugly deveopments.My new home.Rubbish in the car park.Scary hand head.Phantasmo.If you can spot him.Looks like that man from the Buff Meadways or that Chap you always see in Shoreditch with the Great Dane.Chocks away Ginger.Stik.This is how little kids draw skyscrapers but somehow better.

5 miles down the canal , round hackney marshes, round the filter bed. Very slippery indeed.Bean geese down by the canal , yes really they are bean geese.hackney marshes , the football fields , the snow covers up all the rubbish the footballers leave behind. Lazy sods.Jumping fish got stuck in the ice as he re-enters the water.It was very tricky running down this bit there was a lot of sliding and falling.Snow cat in millfields park. Tick v. good

Back from a short hiatus after injury and lack of motivation to...snow. London is great when it snows , there's no point trying to go to work and it covers up the dirt.This is frost rather than snow but blimey it was chilly. I may not be a northerner anymore , I wore a hat all the 5 miles.I think I may officially be a hockey playing,ballet loving,shandy drinking ,southern, cream puff. I once saw a girl in Cumbria in hotpants,moon boots and a bikini top ( no tights obv.) on Christmas eve.Near the docks too,very nippy.Finally started knocking down the old matchbox factory.What a shame.We can look forward to something really ugly and boring in its place.One of those horrid beige buildings they keep putting up with tiny windows.Peace.Its a Christmas dove.This wall, until recently,was covered in very fine graffiti but has been blasted off .It now looks really crap and grubby.This has probly got something to do with the Olympics and everything to do with the people in the new flats opposite not liking it.Oh , its all smudgy.Makes her look all downcast and upset.Scary alien peeping out from behind the door.
