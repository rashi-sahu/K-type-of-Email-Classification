Welcome to the Biological Records Centre
The Biological Records Centre (BRC), established in 1964, is a national focus in the UK for terrestrial and freshwater species recording. BRC works closely with the voluntary recording community, principally through support of national recording schemes and societies.
See our booklet reviewingÂ the first 50 years of BRC.
BRC is supported by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee and the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology within the Natural Environment Research Council.
The work of BRC is a major component of the National Biodiversity Network.
