Great places to see Winter Waders and Wildfowl in Cumbria
Midwinter isn’t necessarily bleak! It can be a wonderful time to get outdoors and enjoy the wealth of wildlife found all across Cumbria. You’ll see a myriad of migratory wildfowl over-wintering on our milder shores and you could be treated to the superb spectacle of large flocks of waders.
Our guide to Great places to see Winter Waders and Wildfowl in Cumbria recommends some great lakes and areas of the coast to spot these amazing sights.

Could you save one acre for nature?
Our wildlife needs a little extra help.
Every acre we protect as part of our network of nature reserves costs on average £96 each year – that’s £8 each month
