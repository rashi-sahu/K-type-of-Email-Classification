Welcome
A unique project recording the people and places affected forever by the development of East London for the 2012 Olympics.
Allan Williams, an artist based in Suffolk and Newham, East London, has made a unique record of the London 2012 Olympic site as it was before development started and he has painted portraits and made sound recordings of the memories, stories and experiences of older people who have lived or worked in the area. The end result is both a visual delight and a valuable archive for the people of Newham and for posterity.
The project has culminated in three public exhibitions in Newham and on the internet. There is also an exhibition scheduled for shortly before th opening of the Games.
The exhibition will also be on permanent display in Stratford â€” venue to be confirmed.
