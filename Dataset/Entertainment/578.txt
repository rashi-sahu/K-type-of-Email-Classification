What did the Olympic and Paralympic Games mean to you?
The 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games were a once in a lifetime event. To record the impact of the Games, from 2010-2012 museums, libraries and archives around the UK supported community groups to collect and create material related to the Games, past and present. This website showcases the results.
