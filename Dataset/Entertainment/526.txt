Olympic News Round-Up

Olympic News Round-Up
2008 is Beijing's Olympic year so we're expecting plenty of 2012 related news, rumblings and international comparisons bouncing round the internet. On the last day of January, our Games have already made the headlines 3 times this week:
When overall costs trebled at the end of last year, the Lottery stepped in with a mega loan to the Olympics. This week, Tessa Jowell announced it might take 10 years after the event for any money to make it back to the Lottery coffers. 2022? We might be ready for an old age grant by then. That's some long term lending.
Back on the building site, the inspirational stingray aquatic centre, animated above, has also trebled in cost, whilst diminishing in size by a third.
Apparently it remains in budget (goodness knows how they've swung that) which is good news as we can't wait to see the wave shaped roof rise over the Olympic gateway.
And finally, in an attempt to scrape together a good news 2012 story, Tessa Jowell mooted transforming part of the cupcake stadium into a school in addition to planned, but as yet unidentified, sporting legacy somethings.
We wait with bated breath for actual information.

Yon aquatic centre can't have trebled in cost and still be on budget at the same time, they are contradictory facts, its got to be one or the other, unless its experiencing some quantum effects on
scale never seen before.
