was
took
around

most
was
done
with
electric

pump
and
the
final
pressure
was
added
with

Last

raced
the

certain
who

was

unsure
what
might
capable
going
into
this
but
knew

better

than
was

Admittedly
was
looking
sneak
under
minutes
but
when
faced
with
the
course
somewhat
testing
and
undulated

through
the
city

was
pleasantly
surprised
with
what
well
with
little
more
weeks
until
Glasgow
the
marathon
work

I guess
technically
the
transition
has
already
started
but
the

will
progress

this

from

thankfully
much

was
also
starting

back
and
despite
excuriating
treatment
which
gained
the
nickname

things
did

seem
getting
Towards
the
later
part

however 
things
just
seem
whenever
sneezed

Apparently
had
two
the
biggest
ever
talking
about
the

The
operation
took
pace
back
March
and
getting
back
into
running
quick
have
hoped
rehab
was
proving
slow
Even
when
was
able
perform
what

not

This
has
proved
the

they

take

Despite
the

the

now
finally
starting

significant

been
the
case

been

for

and
appears
have
payed
off
the
transition
more

been

than

Not

been
injured
and
out

for

any
point

this
cross

lark
was
all

commented

one
benefit
not

much
that
you
have
more
time
spend
doing
the
the
little
that
often
get
sidelined
more
when

sets
Furthermore
also
been
home
more
than

done

been
better
distraction
than

not
happen

months
earlier
would
have
almost
certainly
ended
Olympic
dream
and
whilst
course
reflection
like
most
athletes
sure
this
was
not
initial
The
most
difficult
and
frustrating
thing
about
this
was
that
following
the
Games
London
found
appetite
for
training
and
competition
quite
high
but
was
not
able
put
this
good
use
least
that’s
how
felt
remember
friend
telling
about
athletes
and
support
staff
from
other
sports
who
had
suffered
with
depression
after
the
Olympics
simply
from
going
from
such
goal
and
then
having
nothing
focus
once
the
games
were
guess
whilst
aspirations
London
were
somewhat
modest
comparison
our
many
gold
medallists
still
decided
earlier
the
year
that
would
set
myself
few
short
medium
term
targets
avoid
such
things
the
These
course
those
have
now
since
changed
due
the
injury
but
have
goals
and
has
help
keep
sane
through
can
otherwise
monotonous
cross
training
Certainly
not
being
able
race
for
long
has
been
whilst
over
the
last
couple
years
haven’t
raced
often
some
this
has
still
been
longest
period
without
race
any
have
been
hitting
the
cross
training
fairly
hard
with
two
daily
sessions
involving
mixture
the
cross
aqua
jogging
and
also
conditioning
The
idea
the
moment
strengthen
adductor
and
overall
core
conditioning
prevent
anything
have
started
building
running
it’s
been
 quite
slow
process
but
getting
there
and
seem
making
steady
actually
had
first
pain
free
run
the
other
day
its
funny
how
the
little
things
create
such
immediate
focus
the
stage
simply
continue
progress
with
the
rehab
and
building
the
running
also
think
general
core
conditioning
probably
strong
it’s
been
for
some
time
which
have
actually
put
bit
weight
perhaps
muscles
maybe
just
wishful
thinking
the
skinny

runners
part
but
having
gone
from

loose
too

sleep
over
what
well
still
have
ambitious
goals
for

the
start
racing
maybe
delayed
little
but
want

PB’s
over

still
somewhat
embarrassed
modest
times
over
the

the

Everything
and
more
As ever
another
but
at least
This is
Where
first
all
seems
apt
mention
that
one
the
reasons
that
started
blog
was
that
people
could
follow
pursuit
one
day
becoming
Olympic
Having
now
achieved
that
guess
will
need
change
the
title
notes
the
blog
part
the
show
heard
referred
certainly
lived
all
expectations
and
much
more
for
having
been
World
Champs
and
previous
Commonwealth
Games
had
given
some
championship
experience
but
think
any
British
athlete
could
have
anticipated
how
fantastic
the
games
experience
was
going
Having
the
village
Loughborough
where
was
based
holding
camp
during the
earlier
days
the
games
was
getting
information
and
details
how
great
all
was
and
that
only
fuelled
excitement
part
Watching
the
likes
Jess
Ennis
and
Greg
Rutherford
winning
gold
and
knowing
would
soon
get
the
chance
have
Olympic
moment
sent
goosebumps
down
must
admit
though
there
was
time
when
felt like
the
the
athletics
team
being
not
only
had
the
games
started but
whilst
the
athletics
programme
was
also
underway
was
the
sole
Team
athlete
remaining
guess
fellow
team
mate
and
marathon
runner
Scott
Overall
may
have
also
felt
the
same
given
that
was
his
own
out
Portugal
for
the
remaining
days
before
the
was
worth
the
wait
but
more
the
race
itself
guess
true
Olympic
experience
started
the
day
arrived
that
was
Thursday
days
before
the
Olympic
soon
sent
foot
the
capital
you
could
sense
the
Olympic
vibe
across
the
city
and
everyone
seemed
great
spirits
and
certainly
travelling
Team
kit
also
attracted
fair
bit
Given
that
had
arrived
the
village
only
days
before
race
was
quite
conscious
staying
well
rested
and
not
getting
too
invovled
excited
the
games
However
with
race
finishing
the
city
and
not
the
stadium
was
quite
keen
see
the
stadium
all
its
glory
with
athletics
full
first
night
there
went
stadium
check
out
and
what
night
witnessed
probably
the
best
mens
race
all
with
David
Rudisha
winning
World
and
the
last
home
what
would
normal
pick
you
medal
not

and
some
guy
called
Bolt
also
won

night

were
somewhat
was
the
Olympic
village
the
one
the
biggest

World
with

did at
time
focus
mentally

soak up
thoughts

the

about

This
inevitably
the

that
comes

after

like
comparing
top
companies
AdvoCare
Avon
And
Vemma
out
for
the
count
anyway
Most
MLM

looked
into
are
insufficient
the
prospecting
such
AdvoCare
and
Avon
and
others
They
teach
people

and
friends
and
then
try

those
people

you
already
have
established
trust
with
But
how
could
this
approach
back
For
not
all
your
warm
market
truly
looking
for
what
you
are
offering…
Such
was
the
case
for

you
imagine
trying

that’s
not
interested

kind
stuff
all
are
talking
about
people
that

can
try

Now
there’s
few
reason
made
pretty
specific
like
first
when
you

impossible
because
its

generic

why

Recently
the
famous
MLM
company
Vemma
was
knocked
out
the
industry
the
but
was
deemed
illegal
pyramid
but
many
people
get
confused
aren’t
all
MLM
companies
some
way
shape
form
pyramid
What
makes
MLM
companies
like
Vemma
any
different
than
say
you
see
what
makes

company
MLM
and
not

scheme
which
illegal
that
the
end
the
day
the
company

true

user
than
considered
legal

For
example
company
like
AdvoCare
actually
sells
their
supplements
people
even
when
people
invest
front
become
Advisor
they
can
get
paid
they
are
purchasing
worth
products
there
actual
exchange
When
the
company
takes
turn
the
dark
side
when
they
sell
the
business
opportunity
only
and
real
tangible
product
service
exchanged
the
end
rather
false
promise
business
opportunity
which
most
people
the
company
reaps
revenue
from
duping
with
model
that
counts
people
duping
more
therefore
the
company
not
providing
any
value
customers
This
why
AdvoCare
stresses
the
importance
the
fact
that
they
are
product
oriented
company
and
they
are
big
supporting
and
promoting
their
products
through
paid
endorsers

Vemma
and
countless
other
MLM

they
got
too
greedy
for
their

instead
focusing

development
like
they
should
such
Tesla’s
Elon

stresses
his
people
should
focus
more
the

rather
than
about

Vemma
really
had
the

people
but
one
thing
for
certain
has
stirred
small
uproar
the
MLM
community
where
people
are
questioning
the

You

Some
the
pros
picking

been
around
for
over

last
thing
you
wanna
work

and
then
that
company
gets
attacked
the
FTC
and
get
shut
down
and
you
just
lost
all
your
income
over

what
happened
VEMMA
Its
such
shame
Think
all
the
people
that
lost
their

check
and
now
scrambling
find
another
means
pay
When
you
join
company
like
AVON
they
are
still
definitely
but
the
competition
might
tougher
because
you
are
dealing
with
the
issue
over
when
company
the
more
people
join
the
tougher
becomes
for
new
comers
Maybe
your
local
everyone
has
already
been
shown
about
AVON
another
and
you’re
the
guy
approaching
you
want
find
the
fine
balance
between
stable
company
that’s
been
around
for
little
bit
versus
company
that
has
been
around
too
This
when
pulling
secondary
sources
data
can
helpful
like
what
the
flow
successful
the
the
rate
increasing
each
year
For
AdvoCare
their
number
big
time
distributors
are
increasing
and
seems
that
the
company
building
momentum
reaches
billion
dollar
mark
recently
and
still
AVON
AdvoCare

close
will
