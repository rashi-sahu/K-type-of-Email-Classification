Welcome to the Cleveland Naturalists' Field Club
The Cleveland Naturalists' Field Club is probably one of the oldest clubs in the
Teesside area. It was founded in April 1881, the name of Cleveland Naturalists' Field
Club has been used since 1886. The United Kingdom has a long history of these local
natural history groups and they provide the backbone of knowledge for local and national
surveys of the flora and fauna of Britain.
The web site expands the information given on the Club membership card. Prospective
members who read these pages are invited to join us on a few walks and find out something
about the Club.
The Club seeks to promote an interest in all branches of Natural History and to assist
members in finding out about the living things that they see in the countryside around
them. The present membership includes those who have particular interests in birds,
insects, slugs and snails, lichens, fungi, flowering plants and mosses and liverworts.
Members with interests in other fields would be very welcome.

In spring and summer there are evening, half-day and whole-day visits to investigate
the natural history of a particular area. During the winter months there is a series
of monthly meetings that are held at present at the Nunthorpe Institute in Middlesbrough.
A meeting usually takes the form of a lecture given by a club member or visiting
speaker.
Full details of the walks and their starting points can be found from the links at
the top of the page. If you require further details about a walk, or in the event
of inclement weather and possible cancellation, please contact the leader of the
walk. Please carry suitable refreshment with you! This will be necessary for the
walks that start on a morning and it may well be appropriate to take tea on an afternoon
walk.
