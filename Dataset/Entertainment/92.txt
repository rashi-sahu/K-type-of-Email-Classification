WELCOME to my Website
within which I hope to show you the  wonders of Hainault
Forest from time immemorial - of History, Social History and the
myriad of Wildlife to be found here which should whet the
appetite of many specialities, and those who just want to enjoy
the area for relaxation. Records and photographs gathered over
many decades while living closeby are now supplemented with
photographs by Michael Rumble and Colin Carron and Raymond
Small. We should remember those visionaries who
in 1903 saved a small area of Hainault Forest for our use today.
