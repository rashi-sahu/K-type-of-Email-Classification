Olympic Torch route announced

THE route the Olympic Torch will take across the country and through the district has been unveiled today.
In November it was announced that Stroud and Painswick were to be two of over 1,000 villages, towns and cities through which the Olympic Flame will be carried by Torchbearers, during the London
2012 Olympic Torch Relay.
Councillor Keith Pearson, Stroud District Council’s deputy leader and cabinet member for regeneration said: "2012 is an exciting year for our
nation and it’s a privilege to have the Olympic Torch carried through our district. With the torch carried through Stroud and Painswick only a few days after it arrives in our country, the eyes of
the world will be upon us and I’m sure that people of all ages will line the route and celebrate this special occasion."
On Wednesday, May 23, on the fifth day of its journey, the Olympic Flame will come into our district from Cirencester along the A419. It will then enter the town of Stroud at around 4.15pm and be
carried through the town centre, along London Road, past the Four Clocks and along Rowcroft before passing the new canal bridge and then being carried along Merrywalks.
On its way out of Stroud, it will be carried along Beeches Green and then make its journey towards Painswick to arrive at 5pm. It will be carried through the village along New Street and Cheltenham
Road on its way towards Cheltenham Racecourse, where an evening celebration event will be held.
Also announced today was that Daphne Edwards from the Stroud Valleys Cycling Club and Stonehouse Wheelers has been chosen as one of the Torchbearers. Daphne started cycling when she retired at the
age of 60. Now in her 70’s, she inspires many to take to the road on two wheels regardless of their age or ability.
Daphne added: "It is a great honour to be chosen to carry the Torch. Whilst I was never cut out to be an Olympic athlete I am delighted that my grandchildren can say that their grandma will be
taking part in the 2012 Olympic Games!’ [Profile of Daphne below – in Further Information section] Painswick Parish
Council chairman Terry Parker, said: "The whole community is greatly looking forward to welcoming the Olympic Torch and will be celebrating this once in a lifetime event with various
activities. These will include Painswick's younger members taking part in a number of sports."
Stroud Town Mayor John Marjoram added: "I’m sure the people of Stroud will be looking forward to seeing the ethics of fair play on display at the Olympics."
In the build up to the start of the Games, the Olympic Flame will make its journey from Greece and arrive in the UK on 18 May, ready for the Olympic Torch Relay to begin the following day.
Representing peace, unity and friendship, the Flame will start its 70-day journey around the UK towards the Stadium carried by 8,000 inspirational Torchbearers.
The Relay will start its 70-day journey at Land’s End, Cornwall on the morning of 19 May. On leaving Land’s End, the Olympic Flame will travel an estimated 8,000 miles around the UK giving
thousands of communities and individuals a chance to see it and celebrate.
Further details on the Torch Relay and route along which the Torch will be carried can be viewed at www.london2012.com/olympictorchrelay or at www.stroud.gov.uk/london2012 Sebastian Coe, Chair of
LOCOG added: "Today we bring the Olympic Torch Relay to life. The Flame symbolises the Olympic spirit and its journey around the UK will bring the excitement of the Games to our streets. Now the
people know the route the Olympic Flame will be carried along and the Torchbearers for their community, they can start planning how they might celebrate and make it Stroud District’s moment to
shine."
