Olympic torch route for St Helens revealed
Olympic torch route for St Helens revealed
12 comments
THE route the Olympic torch relay will take through St Helens and Prescot can be revealed today.
The flame will arrive in the town on Friday, June 1, near Windle Island and will be carried along a series of roads in the borough by torchbearers before reaching the Prescot border before heading
through Knowsley Safari Park.
St Helens Council, which expects thousands of people to line the streets to watch the relay ahead of London 2012, says the torch will be brought into St Helens in a special vehicle convoy along the
East Lancs Road.
The flame, that will arrive in England from Greece on May 18 and light the London 2012 games, will begin its journey at Rainford Road - at about 2.10pm - near St Helens Crematorium.
A torchbearer will carry it along Rainford Road and then down Greenfield Road before a changeover where the road meets Dentons Green Lane.
It will then turn right at the Lingholme pub into Boundary Road and then left into Kirkland Street, past the Asda supermarket, before reaching the large roundabout at the bottom of Westfield
Street.
From there it will travel up Westfield Street towards Borough Road and into Prescot Road before leaving the borough at the Prescot boundary.
Hundreds of schoolchildren are expected to join those lining the route, with many already involved in projects to make banners and flags.
It will be carried by people been chosen for their work in the community or sport.
So far the names of the St Helens torchbearers have not been revealed.
However, Knowsley Council has confirmed that 14-year-old De La Salle pupil Claudia Dowdeswell, an outstanding Liverpool St Helens rugby union player, will carry the torch into the safari park.
A major community event will be staged at the wildlife park to mark the flame’s arrival, including a weekend of celebrations.
The party will span the double bank holiday and will also mark the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations which are happening this summer.
St Helens Council’s Cabinet Member for Culture, Sport and Leisure Councillor Eric Smith said: “It will be the moment that the Olympics are really brought to life for the people of St Helens.
“It will be an inspirational, once-in-a-lifetime experience and we hope to see as many people as possible getting involved.”
The route will be open to spectators, but key viewing points will be identified in the run-up to the event, said St Helens Council in a statement, which added: “There’ll be plenty of room get a
good viewing position along the way, but space is likely to be more limited nearer to the town centre.
“Wherever possible, spectators will be positioned on the left hand side of the road to allow pedestrians to move freely on the other side.”
The torch will make a 70-day journey around the UK towards the Olympic Stadium and will be carried by 8,000 torchbearers.
Communities will also be opportunities to hold street parties to mark the torch’s arrival.
For those interested in getting more involved with the celebrations, you can visit www.london2012.com/olympictorchrelay and click on the ‘Get Ready to Celebrate’ banner.
Here you can find tips and advice on how to stage an Olympic street party or line the torch relay route with banners and bunting.
Knowsley Council’s Arts and Heritage Service will also be holding craft sessions to show people how to make bunting and carnival items to line the route. To find out more ring Jo Dry on 443 5619.

The names of the torchbearers are on the Olympic 2012 website and only 1 of them is from St. Helens, why?

I am with you on this, absolutely ridiculous, a lot of people in St Helens put forward the same names e.g Andy Reid and Steve Prescott to name 2.
Absolutely ridiculous.

Does anyone know if 'home town' means where they reside now or just where there from originally? i know some people have been allocated a place because the torch isnt passing through their area etc
Ohh and its worse in warrington, most of the route is a 'private event' for the BT staff at the call centre as BT are one of the sponsors!!!

I'm really looking forward to seeing this - but it sounds as though organisation has been a bit poor.
