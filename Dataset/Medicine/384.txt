We need your help…
It's estimated that 1,000 people die from meningitis and septicaemia every day. Many more are left with life-long disabilities. We have invested over £17m in vital research and health interventions which aid diagnosis. We spend around £1m a year in the UK supporting those affected and providing free information to the public and health care professionals.
