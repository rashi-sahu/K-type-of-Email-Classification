SPIT has a new name.
Welcome to Signed Culture...
You will have tried to access the website of Signed Performance in Theatre but are being redirected to Signed Culture.
We are the same thing, just "bigger and better", serving all the arts now and not just theatre.
After 21 years we have reviewed our activities, widened what we do,  rebranded and created a brand new website.  In future we will
Support all arts and cultural activity in the UK which is accessible to BSL users, including museum and gallery talks delivered by Deaf presenters as well as interpreted theatre performances
Give arts and cultural organisations that wish to make their work accessible to Deaf people and BSL interpreters and Deaf presenters with particular skills and areas of expertise a way of finding each other through our searchable database
Become a one-stop shop for BSL users wishing to find out about accessible arts and culture
We hope you like our new website  and will support us at this exciting time.
Best wishes from everyone at Signed Culture
