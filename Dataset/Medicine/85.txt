Welcome to Brandon Trust
Brandon Trust is a charity supporting adults and children with learning disabilities and autism. We believe that all people with learning disabilities should be able to live a life of freedom with fewer limitations. We work with people who can inspire and enable those we support to set themselves free so they can reach for their dreams and be all they can be.
