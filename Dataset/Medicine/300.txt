About
The Pain Relief Foundation is a UK charity which funds research into the causes and treatment of human chronic pain and is concerned with education of health professionals about pain management.
Registered Charity No 1156227
The Foundation is closely associated with the Pain Clinic at the Walton Centre for Neurology and Neurosurgery NHS Trust. The purpose of the Foundation was the setting up and running of a Pain Research Institute.
Our Story
The Pain Relief Foundation was established as a registered charity in 1979, in response to the need for specialised research into the causes and treatment of chronic pain in humans.
The Research Institute has no official funding from the N.H.S. or any other government body and thus relies entirely on charitable contributions and fund raising. Support to provide the funds for the continuing work of the Institute is vital and any help given is much appreciated.
