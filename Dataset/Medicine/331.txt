Remembering the Raffle Man – Keith Hopkins (1946 – 2017)
15 February, 2017 Website AdminBlog, Homepage4 Comments3
In 2015, Keith Hopkins, known affectionately as “the Raffle Man”, was awarded the lifetime achievement award by RGA UK, in recognition for his tireless fundraising at conventions over many years.
Aldo Navato recalls: he was the “most charming and likeable man. [He] could be outrageously and unintentionally funny, which is why I thought the world of him. No equal as a relentless separator of member and hard-earned raffle money.” April Barrett recollects how Keith “was one in a million, and [I] so loved chatting to [him] at conventions. We also had a few great dances in the early years too!”
It took some years for Keith to find RGA UK, but, after joining in 1989, he soon became an active member and only missed one convention in all his time. In recent years, he enjoyed sitting back and having a more relaxed time at the organisation’s annual events. Many more of his friends have recalled how he was a big part in conventions over many years.
He also travelled to many of the regional events, held across the country. Steph Birch remembers from her time as the Chair: “wherever the RGA had hired a village hall and a children’s entertainer, Keith would be there with his friends Pam and Chris. No distance seemed too far and he always enjoyed talking to everyone – young and old. Raffles weren’t limited to convention; he would help out wherever and whenever he could. Each time we’ve seen him, he would always talk to the children and ask how they were getting on. He was a very gentle man and his presence at these events meant a lot to us as a family”.
Keith was born in London and described himself as a happy child with blond curly hair. His Dad also had Achondroplasia and his Mum was average height. He was an only child, but close to his cousins and wider family throughout his life. He took regular holidays to stay with his cousin Tony in Winchester.
In Keith’s early years, he was educated in a school for children with special needs – not uncommon for the time, when children with differences were often educated separately from the mainstream. After leaving education, he joined his dad’s workplace and was employed as an office clerk at Morganite. He started work in London. When the factory transferred to Swansea, he moved there, with his family. Here Keith worked throughout his career until retirement, aged 65. The city became home for Keith and he supported Swansea City Football Club.
Keith had many interests outside of RGA. He loved classical music and enjoyed more contemporary artists, such as Catherine Jenkins. Driving gave Keith independence and pleasure. Meteorology was a keen interest. Keith followed the pressure charts and enjoyed the cerebral challenge of interpreting the anticipated weather. He cared about the Royal Family and sent the Queen and other senior royals cards, to show his support. Keith also had a strong personal faith, which gave him great comfort.
In the last couple of years, friends could see Keith becoming more frail. Despite his poor health, he continued to live independently – staying active, and getting out and about. He was at the recent RGA convention in October – once again, his raffle bucket in hand.
He passed away aged 70 after a short stay in hospital, where he was receiving treatment for heart problems.
Keith’s family have asked for donations to the RGA, in lieu of flowers. Friends are welcome to attend the funeral, which is to be held at Morriston Crematorium, Swansea SA6 6BY at 11am on 24th February.
Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this time.

Leave.EU ‘Turf out the dwarf’ campaign ‘disablist’ and ‘disgraceful’, says RGA UK
7 February, 2017 Website AdminHomepage, News & Press Releases, Uncategorized1 Comment0
A leading charity for people with dwarfism has slammed a Leave.EU social media campaign – which showed a photo-shopped image of the House of Commons Speaker, John Bercow MP, as a dwarf about to be thrown by a group of men, with the banner and hashtag ‘Turf Out the Dwarf’ – as ‘disgraceful’ and ‘disablist’.
The image and slogan were tweeted by @Leave.EU, supposedly in response to Mr Bercow’s recent comments about US President Donald Trump speaking in Parliament.
A RGA UK spokesman said: “Whatever your politics, we hope most people would agree that using the term ‘dwarf’ as a slur and celebrating – as this picture does – acts of physical violence against people with dwarfism is disgraceful and disablist.
“This isn’t about ‘political correctness’; it’s about dwarfism still being an acceptable target for prejudice and abuse.
“It’s a sad reminder that we still have far to go, as a society.”
At the time of writing, the Tweet can still be seen on the @Leave.EU twitter feed.
Some sad news
6 February, 2017 Website AdminBlog, Homepage, News & Press Releases1 Comment4
Dear friends, members, and supporters,
It is with a heavy heart that we have to tell you one of our well-known and much-loved members, Keith Hopkins, has sadly passed on.
Keith was an integral part of our community and our charity, for which he generously volunteered – often running our annual raffle – for many years. He was a kind and gentle character, genuine and welcoming.
We have now had confirmation about Keith’s funeral, which will take place on February 24th 2017.
If you knew Keith well and you would like to attend, please contact Adelina at RGA UK for further details (office@restrictedgrowth.co.uk).
If you would like to, it was Keith’s family’s kind suggestion that friends and family donate to the RGA – instead of providing flowers.
His family have arranged for the funeral directors to handle donations, through Graham Sullivan Funeral Directors, Ty-Hedd Funeral Home, Myndd Garnllwyd Road, Morriston, Swansea, SA6 7QG.
RGA UK was close to Keith’s heart, as he was to ours. We will all miss him.
Please pass this information on to anyone you think would like to know.
We are sorry to have to share such sad news.
The team at RGA UK.
Happy Holidays from Team RGA!

Load MoreRGA Mega Weekend 2016
A huge thank you to all our members and supporters who attended our annual Mega Weekend event in October in Warwickshire. It was fantastic to see so many families coming together, united by their support for a better society for people with dwarfism.
We’ve had some wonderful feedback from our members who attended:
“We had an absolutely lovely time… We loved the relaxed atmosphere you all created. We didn’t feel obliged to do anything we weren’t comfortable with, everyone we met was chatty and friendly (seeking us out to be so), and the programme wasn’t so jam packed we felt overwhelmed… We decided before we’d left that we’ll definitely be back, so please let us know when you plan the next one so that I can make sure our calendar is free!” – Helen
“We had a really great weekend thank you and all enjoyed it so much. We were really impressed with how well organised it was.” – Sophie
“This was our first social occasion with RGA and we are not involved with any other groups. The weekend was amazing, we all had a wonderful time. The venue was excellent, fantastic food and the staff were all so friendly and helpful. The committee must have worked so hard to put on such a fantastic weekend. We are all looking forward to next year.” – Joan
Missed out this year? Don’t worry: next year will be even better!
