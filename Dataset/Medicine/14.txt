ABOUT
We use safe methods to help without drugs or surgery - holistic therapies support
your pet’s own natural healthcare systems.
Our Animal Health Centre provides gentle holistic therapies complementary to veterinary
medicine skills.
We have long experience backed up with training and qualifications.
So here we are at the end of 2016. Where has it gone?
It has been a year with lots of highs and lots of lows for many.
For me, it has been a very busy one with my high being the creation of RAMP. This
is the Register of Animal Musculoskeletal Practitioners - a national organisation
listing all those who reach the Gold Standard of practice using chiropractic, osteopathic
and physiotherapy techniques for animals.
This started three years ago when I held the position of President of the McTimoney
Chiropractic Association, Animal Group and the Director of Academic Affairs for the
Royal College of Chiropractors Animal Faculty.
DEFRA initiated talks to investigate all those who treat animals but are not vets
because there was such a multitude of practitioners in the market-place, not all
of them properly trained, qualified or insured, that there was becoming a confusion
for the public and also for the vets.
I created an alliance with the regulated practitioners from the professions of osteopathy
and physiotherapy, and discussions with them, the regulators of the three professions,
the RCVS and DEFRA have lead us to form this Register.
We aim to become a one-stop-shop for vets and animal owners to be able to locate
a practitioner who is properly trained, qualified and insured and working to the
high standards we have set. The Register will be easy to use on the website at www.rampregister.org
I expect to be involved with lots more work for this as it becomes established over
the next couple of years.
I have been delighted to see so many patients recover – both human and animal. Some
dogs from the brink of euthanasia returning to almost a hundred percent health. It
is always such a joy for me to hear that they have become mischievous and back to
normal behaviour – whether that is an animal, a baby or a grumpy husband!
On the sadder side, I have have lost several older patients this year, many of whom
had had happy years of borrowed time following chiropractic treatments. My big sadness
this year has been the decision to stop treating cattle and horses. Having had forty
years working professionally with horses I felt it was time to pull back a little
as my own body is beginning to feel the creaks of age.
I listened to Elaine Paige sing 'Don't Cry for Me Argentina' on Strictly Come Dancing
and thought My God you should have stopped when you were ahead. Like ageing singers,
I feel a time comes when you should recognise that you have peaked and I would rather
be remembered for giving a damn good service than for singing out of tune.
I am looking forward to 2017 and all that it brings. Be it my human patients who
have overdone it over the festive period or the many wagging tails who greet me at
my dog clinic, I wish you all a very happy Christmas, a wonderful peaceful and happy
New Year, and ask that you all give a moment of thought to our animal friends in
the wild many of whom are affected by human insensitivities.
Many Blessings Vav.
