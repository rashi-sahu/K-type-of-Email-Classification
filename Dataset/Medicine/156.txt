Supporting a normal lifestyle
The Ectodermal Dysplasia Society is a charity dedicated to improving the health and wellbeing of people whose lives are affected by Ectodermal Dysplasia
(ED). We work together with people who have ED, their families, researchers,
health and other professionals to develop and share expertise, increase
awareness and understanding, and assist with the day-to-day management of ED.
Although the ED Society is based in the UK we support individuals, families
and professionals worldwide. If you are international and there is not a support
organisation in your country please contact us at diana@edsocieity.co.uk
