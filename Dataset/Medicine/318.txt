Welcome!
I have created this website to provide information and support for anyone with an interest in postnatal depression.
This very debilitating illness comes at a time when a woman is supposedly meant to be happy and content, not depressed, anxious and perhaps unable to enjoy her new baby.
Having had postnatal depression after both my girls, and never having been depressed before or since, I can honestly say it was the worst experience I have ever had, thinking I would never be the same person that I was before ( see Liz's Story).I hope this site will give hope to those experiencing postnatal depression, those supporting anyone going through it and and provide general information about this illness.Liz Wise
