100% accuracy at time of writing cannot be guaranteed.  A listing in this website is provided for informational purposes only, and does not mean it is an endorsement.  All companies listed are tried at the reader’s own risk.  All information provided is intended as a supplement to any professional help already
given.  Before acting on suggestions from anyone, ostomates are advised to check with a doctor or stoma care nurse that the course of action is suitable
for them. Whilst every care is taken, the author will not be held responsible.
My name is Jean, and I live in the south west of England.  I have had two stomas since 1995 -
a colostomy and a urostomy - amongst other multi-complex and complicated medical conditions.
Over the years, I have been approached by several medical professionals to talk to patients, before and after surgery.  The surgeons, local doctors and stoma care nurses do a fantastic job, but it is always beneficial to have someone to contact about the everyday, practical side of living with a stoma - someone who has
first-hand experience, i.e. ‘been there, done that’.
I hope that my website will be helpful to everyone, not just for new ostomates.  After all, everyone can learn something new every day, and ostomates are no exception.  With a little care and common sense, you can keep yourself and your stoma healthy, and you can enjoy many of the same things you did before surgery.
There are many ideas on this website, but it is important to remember that if you are unsure about anything, talk to your doctor or stoma care nurse.
