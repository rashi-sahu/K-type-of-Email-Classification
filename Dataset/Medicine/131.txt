With Cued Speech, your deaf baby or deaf child can:
» Understand and use the English Language» Become fully literate
If you have a deaf baby or child, or support one at school or nursery, we can help you communicate, and enable your child to fully learn the English language, by teaching you the simple system of Cued Speech (CS). CS, which can be learnt in about 20 hours, combines eight handshapes in four positions near the mouth, with the lip patterns of normal speech, to make every sound a person is saying visually clear.
CS can work alongside British Sign Language (BSL) for true bilingualism in both BSL and English, and complements the use of hearing aids and implants.
Our charity provides: information about and training in Cued Speech throughout the UK.
To pay for training - click here

If you are the parent of a deaf child or baby, with little to no background knowledge of CS, we recommend you start by reading our basic informtion
If you or your child is a BSL user, visit our page on CS bilingualism to see how both systems can work together
If your child has or might have an aid or implant, go to our section on cochlear implants to find out more.
If you work closely with a deaf child or baby, please start by reading our basic information page
From there, each page can offer insight into the various facets of the CS system
CS can open up educational doors for its young users, and improve their communication in social and home environments
Information sessions can be booked here
Though this site is geared towards younger users, deaf or deafened adults can also benefit from the use of CS
If you are new to CS, start by reading the basics
The adults section will give a brief overview of the benefits of CS to someone deaf, or deafened in later life
If you would like to book a CS Transliterator, please contact us
