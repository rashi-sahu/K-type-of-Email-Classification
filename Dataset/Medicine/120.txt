Diagnosis and management of Silver–Russell syndrome: first international consensus statement
The first international consensus for Silver Russell Syndrome/Russell Silver Syndrome (SRS/RSS) has been established, led by Professor Irene Netchine.
Thirty six experts of Silver Russell Syndrome gathered in 2015 to validate all points relating to the diagnosis, management and treatment of Silver Russell Syndrome, to establish a global consensus, which doctors worldwide could refer to. Six parents of children with RSS/SRS were present, including Nick & Jenny Child from the CGF and representatives from the Magic Foundation (USA), Alice (Belgium) and Afif (France) to share their experiences and knowledge. The full consensus can be found here:
