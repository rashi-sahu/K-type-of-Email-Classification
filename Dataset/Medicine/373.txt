What is Turner Syndrome?The following description of Turner Syndrome (TS) and explanation of some of the issues involved in living with the condition is not definitive and a doctor or endocrine specialist should always be consulted whenever a diagnosis of TS has been given.

It should be emphasised that each girl/woman with TS is an individual and what is relevant to one is not necessarily relevant to another.
Read MoreTreatment for TS
There are a number of treatments available to those with TS, and each girl/woman should be treated according to her individual needs. TS is a ‘cradle to grave’ condition and as such should be treated throughout life in a variety of ways.

Join the SOAR study
We would like to invite you and your daughter to join the SOAR (Social skills and relationships in Turner Syndrome) study. SOAR aims to improve our understanding of the behaviour, development and wellbeing of girls and women with TS.
We are especially interested in social skills, friendships and relationships as know these areas are of great concern to parents as their daughters grow up.
