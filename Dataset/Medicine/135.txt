Swimming Opportunity in London...
Sylvia, a member of the London Adult Burns Support Group, has been
working hard to create opportunities for people with burns, scars and
appearance differences to go swimming in a relaxed, welcoming environment
without fear of being judged by others.
Her hard work is paying off; she is close to agreeing a deal with a leisure company, with pools in
London, to host the group and, depending on the level of interest and success, it
may be possible to expand to other locations and frequency.
Please
contact her at sylvia@lovedisfigure.com for more information, updates, any questions and to register your
interest.
Even if you are not a confident swimmer, Sylvia is a trained
instructor and may well be able to support you in building your confidence in
water.

Welcome to Dan's Fund for Burns
Practical Help For Burns Survivors
A major burn injury can be a lifetime sentence. Recovery often involves prolonged hospitalisation and surgery, immense pain and a lengthy rehabilitation process. However there is an urgent need for support for burn survivors beyond their dismissal from the intensive care and treatment provided in hospital.
Dan's Fund for Burns, a registered burns charity was
established by Polly Miller after her husband Dan, best friend and seven other
friends were killed in the 2002 Bali bombings. Polly was badly burnt herself and
learnt first hand just how painful and devastating, both physically and
emotionally, it is to be burnt. You can read Polly's story in the History section.
The main aim of Dan's Fund for Burns is identifying
those most in need of help and providing it in a swift and practical way. Polly
saw the great need for ongoing support for those affected by burn injuries and
realised there are many victims receiving virtually no support from their family
or the health service. For more information please go to the Aims & Mission section.
Dan's Fund for Burns is here to help you if you are
Burn Survivor and we are always pleased to hear from people like you. Some of
their stories and contributions can be found in the Survivors stories section.

Feature Article
We are delighted to announce an exciting new website, HELLO AGAIN,
sponsored by Dan's Fund for Burns.
It is often difficult to transit from children's services into the bewildering area of adults
This website is for young people transitioning from children's burns
services. As a young person with a burn you may be moving on to an adult
service within the same hospital, or maybe an adult service within a
different hospital. Many young people who have had a burn injury as a
child build up strong and supportive relationships with the burns team
at their children's hospital. Having to move on can be a scary prospect
but can be an exciting change too! Hopefully it will feel like saying
'hello again' ... a friendly welcome from the adult burn care team!
This website aims to provide a helpful source of information for
young people, their parents/carers and health professionals, to ensure
that anyone making this move into adult burn care or away from care
within the children’s hospital setting will find the experience as
smooth as possible.
You may also find some aspects of this website useful if you are
young person living with a burn injury, whether or not you are
‘transitioning’ on to adult services.
