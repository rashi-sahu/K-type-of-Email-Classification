This
a site dedicated to Bipolar Disorder. I was 18 when i first experienced
Bipolar Disorder and soon realised the fact that not many people know
what it is. Bipolar Disorder is more commonly known as a manic-depressive
illness or manic depression. In this site there is factual information
about the illness. It will help you to recognise its symptoms,
how it can be treated and how you can help yourself and others..
