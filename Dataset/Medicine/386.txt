FROM VACCINE AWARENESS NETWORK
Qui medice vivit misere vivit - Roman saying, 'He who Lives Medically Lives Miserably'.
Just what I was seeking, awesome website. Thanks for being such a special person to have created this website. Thank you for being strong and standing up for us with factual information on a controversial subject.
I have a hard time standing up for my baby and myself against vaccines but this website truly encourages me to stand firm. God bless you and your family from the bottom of my heart." - What a member of the public said about this site.
Please be advised we are in the process of modernising this website for your usability and because a web designer is working on it, we will not be updating this site until he has finished. Until then, vaccine news can be obtained from our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/vaccineriskawareness/What We DoV.A.N provides information about vaccinations that is fully sourced to enable parents to make a fully informed choice about their child's vaccinations. For Parents Who Don't Vaccinate
We also provide emotional support to parents who have chosen not to vaccinate, through providing links to scientific studies that support their viewpoint, leaflets to explain to others why they don't vaccinate, template letters for schools and referral for legal advice if they need it.
We have also had meetings for non-vaccinating parents to socialise as well as hosting speakers on natural child-rearing, treatment of childhood illness and pet vaccinations to name a few.
Our website has been archived by the British Library as a site of historical importance and it is part of a special collection on pandemic influenza.V.A.N has presented talks and power point presentations for other groups as well as debating on various radio shows. We have given free information out at festivals and fairs.
We have organised protests against mandatory vaccination as we believe that everyone has the right to choose what is put into their body.
For Students and Researchers
We have taken part in ethics committees, attended a meeting with JCVI members to present the other side of the argument and we regularly assist students with their university research into vaccination issues.
For Parents of Vaccine Injured Children
We support parents of vaccine damaged children, through a counselling line with a fully qualified telephone counsellor and referrals to other organisations who can help and we have assisted members of the public with navigating the Vaccine Damage Payments Scheme and informing them about the Yellow Card Reporting System.
We may be able to provide details of doctors and therapies to help recover vaccine injured children, depending on the circumstances.
Our phone line is entirely FREE for anyone to call.  We also have an email service.
For Parents Who Want to Vaccinate in a Safer Way
We provide support for parents who vaccinate, too. We have discussions of pro-vaccine arguments on our site, a debates page and a page dedicated to delayed, selective and spaced out vaccines.
We can help you find single vaccines (UK and Ireland - but we have also helped Americans find selective 'vax friendly' pediatricians). We offer the latest tips on reducing pain during vaccination as well as ideas for reducing the risk of side-effects.
Our Aims Our aim is to support the right of every parent to give informed consent or informed refusal with ALL the information available. We believe that the 'Cons' of vaccination should also be presented with the 'Pros' in government  information to parents, that GPs should not be able to remove non-vaccinating patients, that single vaccines should be available to selective vaccinating parents on the NHS and that a full compensation scheme should be available to children under 2 and that the amount of compensation should reflect the injury. We also believe that medical studies on vaccination should be independent and not funded by the companies that make them and that vaccine companies should not be protected from prosecution as they currently are.We support the right of every individual to have bodily autonomy in medical care, the right to have access to treatment no matter what the persons choices are and the right to be treated with respect from their healthcare providers.
Vaccine critic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says he will chair Trump’s vaccine safety panelOutspoken vaccine critic Robert Kennedy Jr. said Tuesday that he had accepted a position in Donald Trump’s administration as chair of a panel on vaccine safety and scientific integrity, in what would be the clearest sign yet of the president-elect’s suspicions about vaccines.Kennedy was unequivocal about an offer when speaking to reporters at Trump Tower in New York after the meeting. He also said Trump has doubts and questions about current vaccine policies.
“His opinion doesn’t matter but the science does matter and we ought to be reading the science and we ought to be debating the science,” Kennedy said. “And that everybody ought to be able to be assured that the vaccines that we have — he’s very pro-vaccine, as am I — but they’re as safe as they possibly can be.”Source: Stat, 10th January 2017 - https://www.statnews.com/2017/01/10/trump-vaccine-critic-robert-f-kennedy-jr/
Unvaccinated Children Have Less Pneumonia, Ear Infections, Allergies and Neurodevelopmental Disorders Compared with Vaccinated OnesIn a study of 666 home schooled children, of which 261 were unvaccinated, it was found that while unvaccinated children had a greater chance of chickenpox and pertussis, they were significantly less likely to be diagnosed with ear infections, allergies, pneumonia and neurodevelopmental disorders. Factors associated with neurodevelopmental disorders were vaccination, male gender and pre-term birth.  In addition, premature babies who were vaccinated had a 6.6 fold increase in being diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental disorder than the unvaccinated.The researchers concluded:'In this study based on mothers’ reports, the vaccinated had a higher rate of allergies and NDD than the unvaccinated. Vaccination, but not preterm birth, remained significantly associated with NDD after controlling for other factors. However, preterm birth combined with vaccination was associated with an apparent synergistic increase in the odds of NDD. Further research involving larger, independent samples is needed to verify and understand these unexpected findings in order to optimize the impact of vaccines on children’s health.' Source:  Front. Public Health | doi: 10.3389/fpubh.2016.00270.VAN UK's Comment: This paper was accepted for publication on 21st November, yet almost immediately taken offline because these are results they don't want you to see in this highly political climate. In the 1990's there were a couple of studies done on the health of unvaccinated Steiner School children and on children with 'natural' lifestyles who lived on farms and these showed similar results, yet they were not withrawn immediately.  I believe now that awareness of vaccine side-effects has increased, the schedule has increased and the numbers of affected children have skyrocketed, they are becoming increasingly worried about what this will do to their programme and so are clamping down on any research that shows harm or any discuss of a differing opinion.Here is the abstract and underneath the source link I have placed an archive link (which may soon also be scrubbed).  Please scroll to the bottom of the list of articles about unvaccinated Steiner children for the links.ABSTRACT Background: Vaccinations have prevented millions of infectious illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths among US children. Yet the long-term health outcomes of the routine vaccination program remain unknown. Studies have been recommended by the Institute of Medicine to address this question. Specific Aims: To compare vaccinated and unvaccinated children on a broad range of health outcomes, and to determine whether an association found between vaccination and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), if any, remains significant after adjustment for other measured factors.Design: A cross-sectional survey of mothers of children educated at home.Methods: Homeschool organizations in four states (Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Oregon) were asked to forward an email to their members, requesting mothers to complete an anonymous online questionnaire on the vaccination status and health outcomes of their biological children ages 6 to 12. Results: A total of 415 mothers provided data on 666 children, of which 261 (39%) were unvaccinated. Vaccinated children were significantly less likely than the unvaccinated to have been diagnosed with chickenpox and pertussis, but significantly more likely to have been diagnosed with pneumonia, otitis media, allergies and NDDs (defined as Autism Spectrum Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and/or a learning disability). After adjustment, the factors that remained significantly associated with NDD were vaccination (OR 3.1, 95% CI: 1.4, 6.8), male gender (OR 2.3, 95% CI: 1.2, 4.3), and preterm birth (OR 5.0, 95% CI: 2.3, 11.6). In a final adjusted model, vaccination but not preterm birth remained associated with NDD, while the interaction of preterm birth and vaccination was associated with a 6.6-fold increased odds of NDD (95% CI: 2.8, 15.5).Conclusions: In this study based on mothers’ reports, the vaccinated had a higher rate of allergies and NDD than the unvaccinated. Vaccination, but not preterm birth, remained significantly associated with NDD after controlling for other factors. However, preterm birth combined with vaccination was associated with an apparent synergistic increase in the odds of NDD. Further research involving larger, independent samples is needed to verify and understand these unexpected findings in order to optimize the impact of vaccines on children’s health. Here are previous small unvaccinated/selective vaccinated studies that weren't withdrawn:
Allergic disease and atopic sensitization in children in relation to measles vaccination and measles infection.
Abstract
OBJECTIVE:
Our aim was to investigate the role of measles vaccination and measles infection in the development of allergic disease and atopic sensitization.
METHODS:
A total of 14 893 children were included from the cross-sectional, multicenter Prevention of Allergy-Risk Factors for Sensitization in Children Related to Farming and Anthroposophic Lifestyle study, conducted in 5 European countries (Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland). The children were between 5 and 13 years of age and represented farm children, Steiner-school children, and 2 reference groups. Children attending Steiner schools often have an anthroposophic (holistic) lifestyle in which some immunizations are avoided or postponed. Parental questionnaires provided information on exposure and lifestyle factors as well as symptoms and diagnoses in the children. A sample of the children was invited for additional tests, and 4049 children provided a blood sample for immunoglobulin E analyses. Only children with complete information on measles vaccination and infection were included in the analyses (84%).
RESULTS:
In the whole group of children, atopic sensitization was inversely associated with measles infection, and a similar tendency was seen for measles vaccination. To reduce risks of disease-related modification of exposure, children who reported symptoms of wheezing and/or eczema debuting during first year of life were excluded from some analyses. After this exclusion, inverse associations were observed between measles infection and "any allergic symptom" and "any diagnosis of allergy by a physician." However, no associations were found between measles vaccination and allergic disease.
CONCLUSION:
Our data suggest that measles infection may protect against allergic disease in children.(Pediatrics. 2009 Mar;123(3):771-8. doi: 10.1542/peds.2008-0013).
Allergic diseases and atopic sensitization in children related to farming and anthroposophic lifestyle--the PARSIFAL study.(Steiner kids are usually unvaccinated or minimally vaccinated, they have a higher usage of homeopathy and herbs, lower usage of antibiotics and drugs, and are more likely to eat organic foods).
Abstract
BACKGROUND:
The prevalence of allergic diseases has increased rapidly in recent decades, particularly in children. For adequate prevention it is important not only to identify risk factors, but also possible protective factors. The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of allergic diseases and sensitization between farm children, children in anthroposophic families, and reference children, with the aim to identify factors that may protect against allergic disease.
METHODS:
The study was of cross-sectional design and included 14,893 children, aged 5-13 years, from farm families, anthroposophic families (recruited from Steiner schools) and reference children in Austria, Germany, The Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. A detailed questionnaire was completed and allergen-specific IgE was measured in blood.
RESULTS:
Growing up on a farm was found to have a protective effect against all outcomes studied, both self-reported, such as rhinoconjunctivitis, wheezing, atopic eczema and asthma and sensitization (allergen specific IgE > or = 0.35 kU/l). The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for current rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms was 0.50 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38-0.65) and for atopic sensitization 0.53 (95% CI 0.42-0.67) for the farm children compared to their references. The prevalence of allergic symptoms and sensitization was also lower among Steiner school children compared to reference children, but the difference was less pronounced and not as consistent between countries, adjusted OR for current rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms was 0.69 (95% CI 0.56-0.86) and for atopic sensitization 0.73 (95% CI 0.58-0.92).
CONCLUSIONS:
This study indicates that growing up on a farm, and to a lesser extent leading an anthroposophic life style may confer protection from both sensitization and allergic diseases in childhood.

Allergic disease and sensitization in Steiner school children.Abstract
BACKGROUND:
The anthroposophic lifestyle has several features of interest in relation to allergy: for example, a restrictive use of antibiotics and certain vaccinations. In a previous Swedish study, Steiner school children (who often have an anthroposophic lifestyle) showed a reduced risk of atopy, but specific protective factors could not be identified.
OBJECTIVE:
To investigate factors that may contribute to the lower risk of allergy among Steiner school children.
METHODS:
Cross-sectional multicenter study including 6630 children age 5 to 13 years (4606 from Steiner schools and 2024 from reference schools) in 5 European countries.
RESULTS:
The prevalence of several studied outcomes was lower in Steiner school children than in the reference group. Overall, there were statistically significant reduced risks for rhinoconjunctivitis, atopic eczema, and atopic sensitization (allergen-specific IgE > or =0.35 kU/L), with some heterogeneity between the countries. Focusing on doctor-diagnosed disease, use of antibiotics during first year of life was associated with increased risks of rhinoconjunctivitis (odds ratio [OR], 1.97; 95% CI, 1.26-3.08), asthma (OR, 2.79; 95% CI, 2.03-3.83), and atopic eczema (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.22-2.17). Early use of antipyretics was related to an increased risk of asthma (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.11-2.13) and atopic eczema (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.02-1.71). Children having received measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination showed an increased risk of rhinoconjunctivitis, whereas measles infection was associated with a lower risk of IgE-mediated eczema.
CONCLUSION:
Certain features of the anthroposophic lifestyle, such as restrictive use of antibiotics and antipyretics, are associated with a reduced risk of allergic disease in children.J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2006 Jan;117(1):59-66. Epub 2005 Nov 28.
Atopy in children of families with an anthroposophic lifestyle.
Abstract
BACKGROUND:
Increased prevalence of atopic disorders in children may be associated with changes in types of childhood infections, vaccination programmes, and intestinal microflora. People who follow an anthroposophic way of life use antibiotics restrictively, have few vaccinations, and their diet usually contains live lactobacilli, which may affect the intestinal microflora. We aimed to study the prevalence of atopy in children from anthroposophic families and the influence of an anthroposophic lifestyle on atopy prevalence.
METHODS:
In a cross-sectional study, 295 children aged 5-13 years at two anthroposophic (Steiner) schools near Stockholm, Sweden, were compared with 380 children of the same age at two neighbouring schools in terms of history of atopic and infectious diseases, use of antibiotics and vaccinations, and social and environmental variables. Skin-prick tests were done for 13 common allergens, and we took blood samples from children and their parents for analysis of allergen-specific serum IgE-antibodies.
FINDINGS:
At the Steiner schools, 52% of the children had had antibiotics in the past, compared with 90% in the control schools. 18% and 93% of children, respectively, had had combined immunisation against measles, mumps, and rubella, and 61% of the children at the Steiner schools had had measles. Fermented vegetables, containing live lactobacilli, were consumed by 63% of the children at Steiner schools, compared with 4.5% at the control schools. Skin-prick tests and blood tests showed that the children from Steiner schools had lower prevalence of atopy than controls (odds ratio 0.62 [95% CI 0.43-0.91]). There was an inverse relation between the number of characteristic features of an anthroposophic lifestyle and risk of atopy (p for trend=0.01).
INTERPRETATION:
Prevalence of atopy is lower in children from anthroposophic families than in children from other families. Lifestyle factors associated with anthroposophy may lessen the risk of atopy in childhood.Lancet. 1999 May 1;353(9163):1485-8.These studies of the late 1990's, early 2000's mentioned low vaccination in their studies that showed less allergy and these research articles remained published. What made the difference in our opinion was the mention of 'neurodevelopmental disorder' - governments cannot allow any mention of that in association with vaccination as they are liable.On a similar note, here is a new study showing that children vaccinated with multiple vaccines in one visit have an increased rate of hospitalisation from lower respiratory infections.  Simultaneous vaccine admission was associated with a 7% increase in infectious disease admissions.
Simultaneous vaccination with MMR and DTaP-IPV-Hib and rate of hospital admissions with any infections: A nationwide register based cohort study
Results
By 2 years of age, 4965 children had simultaneous MMR and DTaP-IPV-Hib as their most recent vaccination. Compared with MMR alone, simultaneous administration was associated with a higher rate of lower respiratory tract infections (adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR), 1.27; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.13–1.42). There was no effect on other infections. Overall, simultaneous administration was associated with a 7% (95% CI, 0–15%) increase in infectious disease admissions.
Conclusions
Simultaneous administration of MMR and DTaP-IPV-Hib compared with MMR alone may increase the rate of hospital admissions related to lower respiratory tract infections. These findings require replication in other high-income settings.

Texas DA Says Vaccines Cause Autism, Tells of Son's Vaccine Injury
Family and Detective Say Dr Jeff Bradstreet was Murdered
Dr. Jeffrey Bradstreet was an outspoken proponent of the theory that vaccinations cause autism. Shortly before his death, he was working on a controversial molecule that occurs naturally in the body that would have been capable of reversing autism.
Dr Bradstreet was found dead with a single gunshot wound to the chest, floating in a North Carolina river last year. Due to the controversial nature of his work, his family believed that the government or Big Pharma had a hand in his death.
Naturalnews.com reports:
Due to the controversial nature of Bradstreet’s research, as well as the fact that his office was raided by officials with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the days leading up his death, the physician’s family hired a private investigator in hopes of finding the truth about Bradstreet’s untimely demise.
‘It is our 100 percent belief that Jeff did not commit suicide’
Finally, new details regarding Bradstreet’s death have been revealed through a recent interview conducted by the producer of the documentary VAXXED. Polly Tommey sat down with Bradstreet’s baby brother Thom and his lovely wife Candice at the AutismOne conference held towards the end of last month at the Loews Chicago O’Hare Hotel in Rosemont, Illinois.
Thom said that while the family knew in their hearts that Bradstreet was murdered, it wasn’t until they had the opportunity to review the case forensically that they realized the evidence supports their theory that his death was in no possible way a suicide, as has been reported by police and the mainstream media.
“People who knew him knew he would never take his own life,” said Thom, adding that information uncovered by a forensic scientist hired by the family validates that conjecture. After meeting with the medical examiner and reviewing case files and photographs, the private forensic scientist ruled that Bradstreet’s death was absolutely not a suicide.
“It is our 100 percent belief that Jeff did not commit suicide. Not only because of who Jeff was as a person, but because we looked at the science of it; we looked at the medical proof and it’s just not possible that Jeff took his own life,” commented Thom.
“Unfortunately, there’s an ongoing investigation so there’s not a lot we can share about the specifics. But the way the bullet entered into the body, it’s almost impossible for an individual to do that and it was far enough away that it left no tattooing, no significant burn marks or anything like that.”
‘Where would the world of autism be without Jeff Bradstreet?’
Bradstreet’s younger brother noted that while it would be easy to say the murder was a conspiracy due to his controversial (and highly effective) work, they can’t yet say for sure, adding that they must know for sure before reaching any conclusions regarding the perpetrator(s)’ identity.
The family said that while they are still overcome with immense sadness, they know that Bradstreet is in heaven because he was a “great man of faith” who loved God.
“The sadness is to know that there’s all these parents out here, existing patients of Jeff or recently diagnosed, where do they go? Where would the world of autism be without Jeff Bradstreet? [Without] his 20 years of knowledge and input and experience, where would we be?” asked Thom.
The Bradstreets asked the public for patience while they attempt to uncover who may have been behind their loved one’s death.
“Have patience. Be in prayer. Stay actively involved in the world of autism,” said Thom, adding that supporting projects like VAXXED is a great way to continue Bradstreet’s legacy.Source: Your News Wire, 10 June 2016.http://yournewswire.com/police-doctor-who-linked-vaccines-to-autism-was-murdered/
Turkish Court Rules Against Mandatory Vaccination, Declaring it a Violation of Human Rights
On May 4, the Court of Cassation, or Supreme Court of Appeals – Turkey's top administrative court - ruled against mandatory vaccination, saying that the program would lead to violation of individual rights. Again, on May 11, the same court ruled in favor of parents who did not want their kids to be vaccinated.
In its recent rulings, the Constitutional Court, the highest body in the Turkish judiciary, decided that the current immunization program could not continue as it lacked a valid legal framework. On Dec. 24, 2015, the same court said the existing law did not permit the authorities to act against parents’ wishes.Source: aa.com, 20th May 2016.

American College of Pediatricians Warn Against Gardasil Causing Premature Menopause and They No Longer Recommend It.
The American College of Pediatricians wrote in a statement:'It has recently come to the attention of the College that one of the recommended vaccines could possibly be associated with the very rare but serious condition of premature ovarian failure, also known as premature menopause. There have been two case reports (three cases each) since 2013 in which post-menarcheal adolescent girls developed laboratory documented POF within weeks to several years of receiving Gardasil, a 4 strain human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV4). Adverse events that occur after vaccines are frequently not caused by the vaccine and there has not been a noticable rise in POF cases in the last nine years since HPV4 vaccine has been widely used.Nevertheless, there are legitimate concerns that should be addressed: 1. Long-term ovarian function was not assessed in either the original rat safety studies or in the human vaccine trials. 2. Most primary care physicians are probably unaware of the possible association between HPV4 and POF and may not consider reporting POF cases or prolonged amenorrhea (missing menstrual periods) to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). 3. Potential mechanisms of action have been postulated based on auto-immune associations with the aluminium adjuvant used and previously documented ovarian toxicity in rats from another component, polysorbate 80 and since licensure of Gardasil in 2006, there have been about 213 VAERS reports involving amenorrhea, POF or premature menopause, 88% of which have been associated with Gardasil.The two strain, HPV2, Cervarix, was licenced late in 2009 and accounts for 4.7% of VAERS amenorrhea reports since 2006 and 8.5% of these reports from February 2010 through May 2015. This compares the pre-HPV vaccine period from 1990 to 2006 when no cases of POF or premature menopause and 32 cases of amenorrhea were reported to VAERS.Many adolescent females are vaccinated with influenza, meningococcal and tetanus vaccines without getting Gardasil, and yet only 5.6% of reports related to ovarian dysfunction since 2006 are associated with such vaccines in the absence of simultaneous Gardasil administration. The overwhelming majority (76%) of VAERS reports since 2006 with ovarian failure, premature menopause and/or amenorrhea are associated solely with Gardasil......few other vaccines besides Gardasil that are administered in adolescence contain polysorbate 80. Pre-licensure trials for Gardasil used polysorbate 80 as a placebo as well as aluminium adjuvant. Therefore if such ingredients could cause ovarian dysfunction, an increase in amenorrhea probably would not have been detected in a placebo controlled trial. Furthermore, a large number of girls in the original trial were taking hormonal contraceptives which can mask symptoms of ovarian dysfunction, including amenorrhea and premature ovarian failure. Thus, a causal relationship between Human Papillomavirus vaccines (if not Gardasil specifically) and ovarian dysfunction cannot be ruled out at this time.

Nepal Parliament Makes Vaccine Providers Liable for Vaccine Injuries and Death
The Nepal government have passed a bill making vaccine providers liable for vaccine injuries or death. In the event of a death or injury, they will have to compensate the victim or his family.Administering out of date or faulty products or giving a vaccine without permission will also make them liable to pay compensation.  If a centre is found to be vaccinating without consent, their centre will also be closed down.Source: The Himalayan Times, January 5th, 2016.VAN UK's Comment: Hopefully other countries will take Nepal's example and put people before profit.

Imperfect Vaccination Can Enhance the Transmission of Highly Virulent Pathogens
Could some vaccines drive the evolution of more virulent pathogens? Conventional wisdom is that natural selection will remove highly lethal pathogens if host death greatly reduces transmission. Vaccines that keep hosts alive but still allow transmission could thus allow very virulent strains to circulate in a population. Here we show experimentally that immunization of chickens against Marek's disease virus enhances the fitness of more virulent strains, making it possible for hyperpathogenic strains to transmit.Source: Imperfect Vaccination Can Enhance the Transmission of Highly Virulent Pathogens

Rotavirus Vaccine Sheds Hybrid Human/Bovine Bug That Can Infect Others!
On going through some more research papers on the rotavirus vaccine, I have discovered that the vaccine strain rotavirus is combining with the bovine products in the vaccine to create a new, reassorted hybrid human/bovine gastroenteritis that vaccinated children can pass on to others including the unvaccinated. See these links for details:

Measles Epidemics in Very Young and Older People is Caused by Vaccination!
The outbreak of measles at Orlando, Florida was followed by a barrage of what can only be described as legalised 'hate' speech against parents who choose not to vaccinate (and parents who watched their children descend into chronic ill health and disability and who have elected not to give them anymore).  Apart from the fact that health authorities, drug companies and the media are inciting this hate speech without knowing who the 'index' child is and using an outbreak as publicity to promote MMR, they are also withholding the fact that large outbreaks of measles WILL occur because of the very vaccination programme they are promoting!Mothers used to have what was essentially life-long immunity to measles because they had got it as little girls. They then passed transplacental immunity to their babies (and antibodies to measles in breast milk, if they breastfed) to protect them in their most vulnerable early years. Most children, then, would get measles after babyhood but before their teens at a time when it was most benign.They would then have immunity which was constantly re-boosted by frequent exposure to circulating virus in the community. Some children would be immune without even showing symptoms of illness - exposure was enough. This is nature's plan and meant that fetuses were protected during pregnancy and during the first year of life. It also meant that late teens and adults were protected (as measles is adulthood has a much higher rate of encephalitis).Now, the majority of mothers are vaccinated, meaning that they can't pass transplacental or breast milk antibodies, putting their babies at risk from the start. The antibody response elicited from vaccination doesn't mean you'll be protected and always wears off after 3 to 5 years, meaning that if you swap your natural immune system for vaccination you are swapping life-long immunity for a deeply inferior and unproven antibody response. Your immune system will no longer be able to make sure you face these viral challenges at an age appropriate time and so you will have to have vaccine booster after vaccine booster because you have no immunity.Vaccine scientists have known this for years but they still choose to simplify the argument by pointing the finger at people who don't vaccinate and suggesting that more vaccination is the answer.  Here are some studies to show that these epidemics are not only vaccine caused and highly expected by the medical community:
Modelling measles re-emergence as a result of waning of immunity in vaccinated populationsAn age-structured mathematical model of measles transmission in a vaccinated population is used to simulate the shift from a population whose immunity is derived from natural infection to a population whose immunity is vaccine-induced. The model incorporates waning of immunity in a population of vaccinees that eventually will become susceptible to a milder form of vaccine-modified measles with a lower transmission potential than unvaccinated classical measles. Using current estimates of duration of vaccine-derived protection, measles would not be expected to re-emerge quickly in countries with sustained high routine vaccine coverage. However, re-emergence is possible to occur several decades after introduction of high levels of vaccination. Time until re-emergence depends primarily on the contagiousness of vaccine-modified measles cases in comparison to classical measles. Interestingly, in a population with a high proportion of vaccinees, vaccine-modified measles and classical measles would occur essentially in the same age groups. Although waning of humoral immunity in vaccinees is widely observed, re-emergence of measles in highly vaccinated populations depends on parameters for which better estimates are needed.Vaccine, Volume 21, Issue 31, 7 November 2003, Pages 4597–4603.Early waning of maternal measles antibodies in era of measles elimination: longitudinal study
Participants Of 221 pregnant women recruited, 207 healthy woman-infant pairs were included—divided into a vaccinated group (n=87) and naturally immune group (n=120), according to vaccination documents and history.
Main outcome measure Measles IgG antibodies measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at seven time points (week 36 of pregnancy, birth (cord), and 1, 6, 9, and 12 months); decay of maternal antibody in infants modelled with linear mixed models.
Results Vaccinated women had significantly fewer IgG antibodies (geometric mean titre 779 (95% confidence interval 581 to 1045) mIU/ml) than did naturally immune women (2687 (2126 to 3373) mIU/ml) (P<0.001). Maternal values were highly correlated with neonatal values (r=0.93 at birth). Infants of vaccinated women had significantly lower antibody concentrations than did infants of naturally immune women (P<0.001 at all ages over the follow-up period). Presence of maternal antibodies endured for a median of 2.61 months—3.78 months for infants of naturally infected women and 0.97 months for infants of vaccinated women. At 6 months of age, more than 99% of infants of vaccinated women and 95% of infants of naturally immune women had lost maternal antibodies according to the model.
Conclusions This study describes a very early susceptibility to measles in infants of both vaccinated women and women with naturally acquired immunity. This finding is important in view of recent outbreaks and is an argument for timeliness of the first dose of a measles vaccine and vaccination of travelling or migrating children under the age of 1 year.BMJ 2010;340:c1626
Passive transmission and persistence of naturally acquired or vaccine-induced maternal antibodies against measles in newborns
This paper reviews literature on passively transferred maternal antibodies against measles in infants. The amount and decay of these antibodies can be a result of changing patterns in society: increasing cohorts of women are vaccinated against measles instead of having naturally acquired immunity, the age of first childbirth is increasing and young adults are less exposed to natural boosters.
The concentration and persistence of maternal antibodies differ in infants of women vaccinated against measles versus infants of naturally immune women. The date for commencing universal measles vaccination should take into account the presence of these antibodies since they can hamper the immunological response to vaccination. Each country should therefore consider adapting the timing of vaccination in relation to its measles sero-epidemiological situation. The possibility of priming the immune system with an early vaccine dose and boosting later on offers opportunities for vaccination at very young age.Vaccine, Volume 25, Issue 34, 21 August 2007, Pages 6296–6304.
Reduced measles immunity in infants in a well-vaccinated population
Abstract
The recommended age for measles vaccination is based in part on information gathered when most mothers had natural measles. Nowadays many mothers have received measles vaccine. To assess this change measles antibody neutralization titers (NT) were determined for 278 mother-infant pairs. One hundred sixty-four mothers, born before 1958, likely had had natural measles (Group 1). Sixty mothers received one to three killed plus one attenuated measles vaccination (Group 2) and 54 received 1 attenuated measles vaccination only (Group 3). NT were determined for the mother and for the infant at birth and in the infant during the fourth and sixth months. Group 1 mothers and infants at every age had higher geometric mean NT than those in Groups 2 or 3 (P < 0.05). By 7 months 65% of Group 1 infants and >90% of Group 2 and 3 infants had an NT < 1:10. The rate of antibody decay was significantly faster for Group 1 infants (P < 0.05). Earlier vaccination in the infant should be considered.Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal, July 1992, July 1992 - Volume 11 - Issue 7
Immunity against measles in populations of women and infants in Poland
During the 1997–1998 measles epidemic in Poland a high attack rate occurred in infants up to 1 year of age (24.6/100,000 in comparison with 5.5/100,000 in total population). Routine vaccination against measles for infants aged 13–15 months was introduced in Poland in 1975, and a second dose added in 1991. The recommended age for measles vaccination was based on information gathered in years when most mothers had a natural measles. Nowadays, many mothers have received measles vaccine.
Early loss of passively acquired measles antibody may occur in infants of women who received measles vaccine, because measles vaccine induces lower antibody titres than does natural infection.
Therefore, measles-specific antibody titres were determined among vaccinated and unvaccinated women as well as among infants, whose mothers were born after 1976 and likely were vaccinated (Group 1), and those, whose mothers were born before 1969 and likely have had a natural measles (Group 2). All women that were born in prevaccination era had significantly higher geometric mean titre (GMT) of measles antibody than those who were vaccinated (P<0.001).
Also infants from Group 2 at every age had higher GMT of measles antibody than those of Group 1. The antibody decay was significantly faster among infants whose mothers acquired immunity by measles vaccination. Because nowadays the majority of women in childbearing age are vaccinated against measles, earlier vaccination in the infants should be considered.Vaccine, Volume 21, Issues 21–22, 20 June 2003, Pages 2948–2953.Due to vaccination not providing life-long immunity and leaving people vulnerable to infection as they get older, measles deaths now only occur in the immuno-compromised or in adults. The UK government said:'Prior to 2006, the last death from acute measles was in 1992. In 2006, there was 1 measles death in a 13-year-old male who had an underlying lung condition and was taking immunosuppressive drugs. Another death in 2008 was also due to acute measles in an unvaccinated child with a congenital immunodeficiency, whose condition did not require treatment with immunoglobulin. In 2013, 1 death was reported in a 25-year-old man following acute pneumonia as a complication of measles.
All other measles deaths since 1992 shown above are in older individuals and were caused by the late effects of measles.'

Indeed, according to WebMD and the CDC, 62% of measles cases they've seen in California are in adults older than 20.(http://www.webmd.com/news/20150203/measles-outbreak-adults-disney).So, having your measles vaccination as a baby just increases your chance of getting it when it is more dangerous, increases your chance of serious complications and increases your chance of dying from measles while not even guaranteeing you will be immune.I certainly wish my mother had forgone the toxic single measles shot she gave me in 1978 and allowed me to benefit from having natural measles and the enduring immunity that it brings.I was lucky enough to have rubella as a child (and as I played truant from school on the day they were giving rubella vaccines to spare myself the shot I never had the vaccine). Because of this, all my blood tests in all five of my pregnancies have come back as 'immune' so I've never had to worry about congenital rubella syndrome and have never been asked to have rubella vaccine after delivery. My immunity is life-long.This is what true immunity is.For a more in depth look at this issue, please see the web page 'Vaccination Destroys Natural Immunity'

Pertussis Outbreak in 99.5% Vaccinated School - the 0.5% Unvaccinated did NOT get the Disease!
An outbreak of whooping cough is being monitored at Monterey Park School in Salinas. So far four students have been diagnosed with the highly contagious respiratory disease.
Principal Brian Hayes and school officials met with parents to offer information and answer questions.
"There really hasn't been a feeling of fear. It's been more of 'what can we do to stop this?'" he said.
The first case was diagnosed on Feb. 25. Three more students from the same fifth grade class also came down with the disease.
Pediatrician Michele Tamse said it can be scary during cold and flu season because at first it's hard to tell the difference between pertussis and the common cold.
"It can be as simple as the common cold initially, but if we start seeing any signs of vomiting or seizures and blueness to the face, then we have to keep that in mind," Tamse said.School officials said of the 524 students at Monterey Park, 99.5 percent are vaccinated, including the four students who have been diagnosed.All four have completed their five-day anti-biotic treatment at home and are back at school.Source: KSBW News, 19 March 2015.

Over 100 Measles Vaccine Deaths, Zero Measles Deaths, Since 04
Over the last decade in the United States, the deaths of over 100 children — at the very least — have been linked to receiving a measles vaccine, compared with zero children dying from the disease itself, according to the U.S. government’s own compiled data. Put another way, an American child would have been infinitely more likely to die after receiving a measles shot, percentage-wise, than from getting the actual measles disease in the last ten years. Thousands more have suffered from adverse reactions to the measles shot and other vaccines. Source: New American, 16th February 2015.

Pediatrician Slams Media for Blaming Parents who Don't Vaccinate on Cases of Measles
As a board certified pediatrician, I took the same oath as all physicians, “to do no harm.”The latest reports blaming a failure of the measles vaccine on the unvaccinated population are not accurate, and in some reports, not true at all.  In fact, over the past 30 years, there have been similar numbers of measles cases reported in various areas of the United States.  Studies published in leading medical journals, such as the New England Journal of Medicine, American Journal of Epidemiology, American Journal of Public Health and others around the world have confirmed small numbers, 75-140 cases of measles annually.  So why then is the latest statistic of over 90 cases of measles spread over 14 states, representing tens of millions of people being billed as an epidemic?The media would have us believe that this is a result of the fringe population of anti-vaxers who refuse to have their children vaccinated according the guidelines of the current vaccine schedule.  Medical reporting has brought to light the glaring ineffectiveness of the measles vaccines in fulfilling their widely claimed promise of preventing outbreaks in highly vaccine compliant populations.  In fact, measles outbreaks have occurred in populations that have been vaccinated on the average of 77%- 99%, not the so-called anti-vaxers.Last year 1 in every 500,000 Americans came down with the measles. Nearly all recovered in a few days without serious consequences.  At the same time 1 in 68 American children were diagnosed with autism or for every case of measles there were 7000 cases of autism.  I ask myself which is the real epidemic here?Full story at Vaccine Impact.

GSK Dump Live Polio Viruses in the Belgian Water Supply
As if mixing anaesthesia with MMR and then administering it to a group of babies two and under wasn't bad enough, the vaccine industry seem determined to damage their reputations. This time the drug giant GSK has dumped live polio viruses into the Belgian water supply!'September is proving to be another tricky month for GlaxoSmithKline's ($GSK) vaccine production operation. Having begun the month by revealing new problems at its Canadian flu vaccine plant and followed that up with a fine for violating the U.S. Clean Air Act last week, GSK has now accidentally dumped live poliovirusinto the Belgian sewer system.
The events became public knowledge after Belgian authorities reported the leak to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Here's what reportedly happened. On September 2 a "human error" resulted in 45 liters of concentrated live poliovirus solution being released from GSK's plant in Rixensart, Belgium. The liquid was processed at a nearby sewage treatment plant and released into a river.
Belgian authorities think the low concentration of any poliovirus that made it to the river and the high rate of vaccine coverage in the country mean the risk of infection is extremely small.'Source: Fierce Vaccines, 25 September 2014.

Doctors Inject Anaesthetic Instead of MMR
Further to the last news report on children dying during an MMR vaccination campaign, it has been discovered that the mind blowingly stupid doctors carrying out the vaccine campaign mixed ANAESTHETIC with the MMR before injecting it into the children!  This demonstrates the dangerousness of mass vaccination campaigns, particularly in developing countries where they are frequently deadly to children due to poorly trained staff, breaks in the cold chain system, expired or banned products being used, re-use of needles and lack of emergency facilities to deal with severe reactions.Here is the report:Immunization teams 'negligent' in vaccines that killed Syrian childrenFifteen Syrian children died this week in Idlib province, in northern Syria, after receiving what was thought to be a measles vaccine during an immunization campaign sponsored by the opposition Syrian National Coalition. An investigation conducted by the opposition’s interim government showed that the children were injected with a strong anaesthetic instead of the measles vaccination. Bashar Kayal was a member of the investigation team and told FRANCE 24 about the circumstances of this “mistake”…
The immunization campaign in opposition-held Idlib province began on Monday, during which over 40,000 children were vaccinated without any incident. The fifteen victims died following second round of vaccinations that took place the next day in several small towns.
"If the team members had just read the labels, they would have realized it was not the right product"Bashar Kayal is one of the doctors in charge of the anti-measles campaign in Idlib province.All the vaccines transit through the medical centre in Jarjanaz. They are kept in a refrigerator and then distributed to the field teams who store them in the different centres in the region. These vaccines are then transported in thermoses before being administered to children in the local towns and cities. As soon as we learned of the deaths of the children in the Maârat al-Naâmane region on Tuesday, we ordered all teams to stop the vaccination campaign. We then verified the remaining vials and gathered all the empty vials that the medical teams had kept.
For one dose of the vaccination, there are two separate vials. One contains a diluting product and the other contains a powder. The two products need to be mixed together before being administered to the patient.
However, on Wednesday, near the city of Sanjar [where two children died], we found a thermos containing vials of atracurium, which is a muscle relaxant typically used in operating rooms. We discovered that this anaesthetic was in fact mixed with the vaccine, instead of the regular diluting product.The children that died received 5 mL of atracurium [typically, the quantity of atracurium administered to a patient undergoing surgery is 0.5 mL], which corresponds to the amount of the diluting product that should have been administered. In the half hour following the injection, the victims suffered from diarrhea and muscular and respiratory paralysis, which killed them. The children ranged in age from six to eighteen months. The older children who received the erroneous treatment suffered from the same symptoms but their bodies were able to withstand the shock, and they survived.
"Several team members were cornered by parents of the victims"
We traced the path the atracurium vials had taken all the way back to the medical centre in Jarjanaz, where all vaccines are stocked in a refrigerator prior to their distribution. In this fridge, we found several vials of this type of muscle relaxant. This find allowed us to establish that the problem had originated there. Those vials didn’t belong there, because the refrigerator was only used to store vaccines and nothing else.
The vials of atracurium and the vials of diluent had the same shape and volume, and appeared essentially the same. However, the labels clearly stated the name of the anaesthetic. And those people in charge of administering the vaccines did not check the labels.
These teams have been administering vaccines on a daily basis since August 25. There are 160 teams deployed throughout the entire province, and each team must immunize roughly 500 children per day. On Tuesday, the team members did not take the time to read the labels, because transporting and administering the vaccines has become a routine for them. They had never had any problems before.This does not in any way absolve them of responsibility. They were clearly negligent. Several of them were cornered by parents of the victims. However, the Free Syrian Army, which currently holds the area, arrested them on Wednesday, and they are now being detained in Jarjanaz while they await their sentence.
The question now is to figure out whether these vials were placed in the refrigerator by mistake, or with the intent to harm.Source: France 24, 19th September 2014
War isn't the only thing killing Syrian children: MMR kills 15
At least 15 children died after receiving vaccinations in rebel-held parts of northwestern Syria, while the death toll from two days of government airstrikes on a central city climbed to nearly 50, a heavy toll even by the vicious standards of the country's civil war, activists said.
The children, some just babies, all exhibited signs of "severe allergic shock" about an hour after they were given a second round of measles vaccinations in Idlib province on Tuesday, with many suffocating to death as their bodies swelled, said physician Abdullah Ajaj, who administered the vaccinations in a medical center in the town of Jarjanaz.
It was unclear what killed the children, but Ajaj said in an interview via Skype that they all exhibited the same symptoms to varying degrees. He said it was the first time he had ever seen such a reaction to vaccinations.
"There was shouting and screaming, it was hard for the parents. You get your child vaccinated and then you find your child dying, it's very hard," Ajaj said. There weren't enough respirators in the clinic, making the situation even worse, he added.
Video footage uploaded to social media showed a medic examining a young girl who was squirming. Another child, in an orange tee-shirt and blue pants, appeared lifeless as a medic administered CPR. He then opened the child's mouth to reveal a swollen, blue-tinged tongue. The footage corresponded with Associated Press reporting of the event.
The Western-backed opposition based in Turkey said it had suspended the second round of measles vaccinations, which began on Monday. The campaign was meant to target 60,000 children. In a statement, it said the vaccines used Tuesday met international standards and did not say what may have caused the deaths.
It is extremely unlikely that the vaccinations killed the children, said Beirut-based public health specialist Fouad Fouad, who said spoiled vaccinations were more or less harmless. "It cannot cause death," he said.
U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said UNICEF and the World Health Organization are "deeply concerned" and awaiting further clarification.Source: Yahoo News, 17 September 2014

Vaccines Declared Low Risk Even Though They Caused 3 Cases of Collapse, 2 Swollen Brains, 2 Anaphylaxis, 2 cases of Polio, 3 cases of TSS, 1 Sepsis, 1 Multiple Organ Failure, 1 Sudden Death and 3 Disabilities
A vaccine safety study never got any crazier. Researchers studying adverse events after vaccination in Cuba found they are 'safe' even though 10 children died, three were disabled and two got polio after the vaccines. 8 of the 13 disabilities and deaths were found to be directly related to vaccination, and the vaccines are still thought of as 'low risk'. One death should have been too many:
ABSTRACT
INTRODUCTION Cuba has implemented an effective National Immunization Program since 1962. The schedule, administered primarily to children, comprises 11 vaccines (8 domestically produced) protecting against 13 diseases. In 1999 Cuba launched a national vaccine adverse event surveillance system to monitor and assess the safety of the immunization program, its vaccination procedures and the products administered.
OBJECTIVES Describe adverse events following vaccination reported in children aged <16 years in Cuba from 1999 through 2008.
METHODS A retrospective descriptive study was conducted of adverse events following vaccination reported from January 1999 through December 2008. Variables used: year, number of adverse events, province, type of vaccine, type and severity of adverse events (common minor, rare, severe), vaccination program errors, number of deaths, and final results of investigations of severe events. Percentages and rates per dose administered were calculated. Adverse event rates were calculated per 100,000 doses administered and by percentages of individual effects among events reported.
RESULTS A total of 45,237,532 vaccine doses were administered, and 26,159 vaccine-associated adverse events were reported (overall rate: 57.8 per 100,000 doses). The group aged 0-5 years reported the highest rate of vaccine-associated adverse events (82/100,000 doses). The DTwP vaccine exhibited the highest rate of adverse events. Common minor events were: fever (17,538), reactions at injection site (4470) and systemic side effects (2422). Rare events (by WHO definition) reported were: persistent crying (2666), hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes (3), encephalopathy (2) and febrile seizures (112). Severe events included: anaphylaxis (2), respiratory distress (1), multiple organ failure (1), sudden death (1), vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (2), toxic shock syndrome (3), and sepsis (1). The 10 deaths and 3 cases of disability were investigated by an expert commission, which concluded that 8 of the 13 severe events were vaccination-related.
CONCLUSIONS Low rates of severe vaccine-associated adverse events observed in this study underline the low risk of vaccination relative to its demonstrated benefits in Cuba. Decision-making for the continued success of the National Immunization Program is supported by reliable information from comprehensive national surveillance with standarized reporting, along with multidisciplinary expert analysis of rare and severe adverse events and program errors.Source:

Statement of William H Thompson Ph.D regarding the 2004 article examining the possibility of a relationship between MMR vaccine and autism
My name is William Thompson. I am a senior scientist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where I have worked since 1998.I regret that my co-authors and I omitted statistically significant information in our 2004 article published in the journal Pediatrics. The omitted data suggested that African American males who recieved the MMR vaccine before the age of 36 months were at increased risk for autism. Decisions were made regarding which findings to report after the data were collected and I believe the final study protocol was not followed. I want to be absolutely clear that I believe vaccines have saved and continue to save countless lives. I would never suggest that any parent avoid vaccinating children of any race. Vaccines prevent serious diseases and the risks associated with their administration are vastly outweighed by their individual and societal benefits. My concern has been the decision to omit relevant findings in a particular study for a particular sub-group for a particular vaccine. There have always been recognised risks for vaccination and I believe it is the responsibility of the CDC to properly convey the risks associated with the receipt of those vaccines.I have had many discussions with Dr. Brian Hooker over the last 10 months regarding vaccines and neurodevelopmental outcomes including autism spectrum disorders. I share his belief that CDC decision making and analyses should be transparent. I was not, however, aware that he was recording any of our conversations, nor was I given any choice over whether my name would be made public or my voice would be put on the internet.I am grateful for the many supportive emails I have recieved over the last several days. I will not be answering any further questions at this time. I am providing information to congressman William Posey and of course will continue to co-operate with congress. I have also offered to assist with re-analysis of the study data or development of further studies. For the time being, however, I am focused on my job and my family. Reasonable scientists can and do differ in their interpretation of information. I will do everything I can to assist any unbiased and objective scientists inside or outside the CDC to analyse data collected by the CDC or other public organisations for the purpose of understanding whether vaccines are associated with an increased risk of autism. There are still more questions than answers and I appreciate that so many families are looking for answers from the scientific community. My colleagues and supervisors at the CDC have been entirely professional since this matter became public. In fact, I have recieved a performance based award after this story came out. I have experienced no pressure or retaliation and certainly was not escorted from the building as some have stated. Source:

It's Not Parents who Don't Vaccinate: Top Pro-Vaccine Scientist Says MMR Doesn't Work
Dr. Gregory Poland, a top pro-vaccine scientist says that MMR simply isn't working and it has caused the re-emergence of measles in developed countries. Despite being a patent holder for various vaccines and on the committees of pharmaceutical companies, Mr. Poland says a large number of people affected in epidemics had already been vaccinated and that many had had two doses. In Canada, over 50% of the individuals with measles had had both the recommended doses.See full article here: http://business.financialpost.com/2014/05/01/lawrence-solomon-vaccines-cant-prevent-measles-outbreaks/

42% of Adverse Reactions in Chinese Children are Caused by Vaccines
A male overrepresentation was observed regarding the total number of reports. The most frequently reported group of drugs were vaccines (42.15%). Skin rash and fever were the commonest symptoms reported in the total pediatric dataset. The proportion of children that suffered from a serious ADR was 2.16% and that for drug related deaths was 0.34%. And we found that the multiple drug exposure experienced a high proportion of serious ADRs compared with the single drug use (χ2=15.99, P<0.0001). Sixty-five percent of ADRs were for children less than 6 years of age. And more than half of reports were from doctors.Source:

FDA Say Whooping Cough Vaccine Doesn't Prevent Spread of Infection and Vaccinated Can Pass Infection to Unvaccinated
Based on an animal model, the study conducted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and published November 25, 2013, in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, shows that acellular pertussis vaccines licensed by the FDA are effective in preventing the disease among those vaccinated, but suggests that they may not prevent infection from the bacteria that causes whooping cough in those vaccinated or its spread to other people, including those who may not be vaccinated.Full announcement here:

Doctor's Consider Discontinuing Vaccines if They Have to Pay
Ten percent of pediatricians say they have seriously considered no longer providing vaccines due to concerns about their cost, according to results from a 2011 survey.If a pediatrician does decide to stop offering vaccines, parents will have to take their children elsewhere to get shots. Lindley stressed that the survey did not address whether doctors had actually discontinued the vaccines, only if they had considered it.
As of 2012, complete vaccinations through age 18 for one child cost about $2,500, the authors write. Vaccines are given during up to 35 separate appointments.
Private pediatric practices purchase these vaccines and are reimbursed in two ways, once for the vaccine itself and once for administration, by either private insurance or public insurance like Medicaid. The amount doctors pay to buy vaccines and the amount they are reimbursed can vary a great deal, the authors note.
On average, Medicaid pays doctors $9.45 for vaccine administration, compared to $16.62 for private insurance companies. With private insurers, doctors can negotiate higher reimbursements.
Doctors who were most dissatisfied with insurance payments were often the same ones who had considered ending their vaccine programs.Source: Reuters, 26 February 2014 -

Only a Handful of Measles Cases in Wales are Confirmed
Despite doctors diagnosing hundreds of people with measles and journalists pronouncing there's a 'deadly' measles epidemic (caused by Andrew Wakefield, of course), only a handful of cases have actually been confirmed by a lab as being the measles virus.See this NHS Wales document on confirmed cases of measles (scroll down to page 18):http://www2.nphs.wales.nhs.uk:8080/CommunitySurveillanceDocs.nsf/3dc04669c9e1eaa880257062003b246b/38c4ee86b5fd701e80257b41003cdc52/$FILE/monthly%20lab%20201303.pdfThis is markedly different from the hundreds of measles cases reported (scroll down to page 4):http://www2.nphs.wales.nhs.uk:8080/CommunitySurveillanceDocs.nsf/3dc04669c9e1eaa880257062003b246b/abefff808d75f76580257b41003cf988/$FILE/monthly%20notif%20201303.pdfThis means that most reported cases of measles are not actually measles.  They have been mis-diagnosed by the doctors, possibly by some in a bid to encourage higher uptake of MMR.The medical profession are blaming the parents of teenagers who did not have their MMR jabs when Andrew Wakefield's 1998 case series on MMR, autism and bowel disease was published.  However, another document from the NHS shows that the highest number of reported cases (not confirmed) was largest in the 1-4 year old group, the age at which most children are having their MMR jabs.http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sitesplus/888/page/66389#dThe coverage rate for the first dose of MMR in Wales is 94.3% and for the second dose it is 89.9%An MMR programme for 16 year olds also had an uptake rate of 91%, so the few confirmed cases of measles wouldn't appear to have anything to do with apathy about vaccination or about the MMR/autism controversy (indeed, rates have increased since 1998).http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sites3/page.cfm?orgid=457&pid=54144It is a shame that parents will never know the vaccine status of those who were confirmed to have measles, but I suspect some of them may have already been vaccinated.Commentary by Joanna, Founder VAN UK.
Vietnam suspends use of Quinvaxem vaccine for children after nine deaths
The Vietnamese Ministry of Health instructed health centers across the country to suspend the use of Quinvaxem vaccine until the World Health Organization reports its final investigation conclusions, local media reported on Thursday.
The ministry released the instruction after local media reported that since November 2012, nine children died after receiving Quinvaxem vaccinations.
The vaccine, administered to children, is a preventative inoculation against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough) , hepatitis B and H. and influenza Type B.
Quinvaxem is manufactured by the Berna Biotech Korea Corporation and was licensed for use in Vietnam's national expanded immunization program sponsored by the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization.
According to the ministry, since June 2010, Vietnam has imported 16.2 million doses of Quinvaxem, 15.2 million doses of which have already been distributed, state-run Voice of Vietnam reported on its website.
The World Health Organization has sent experts to Vietnam to investigate the alleged serious side-effects of Quinvaxem, a 5-in- 1 vaccine for children, following some suspected deaths in the country, according to the report.
Batches of Quinvaxem have also been sent to the United Kingdom for further testing.Source: http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/health/2013-05/09/c_132371052.htm
CDC Says Vaccinated CAN Get Flu after Flu Vaccine
'CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices routinely recommend that annual influenza vaccination efforts continue as long as influenza viruses are circulating (1). Persons aged ≥6 months who have not yet been vaccinated this season should be vaccinated. However, these early VE estimates underscore that some vaccinated persons will become infected with influenza; therefore, antiviral medications should be used as recommended for treatment in patients, regardless of vaccination status. In addition, these results highlight the importance of continued efforts to develop more effective vaccines.'Source: CDC MMWR January 18, 2013 / 62(02);32-35.http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6202a4.htm?s_cid=mm6202a4_w
Another US MMR/Autism Court Win

Petitioners specifically asserted that Ryan “suffered a Vaccine Table Injury, namely, an encephalopathy” as a result of his receipt of the MMR vaccination on December 19, 2003. Id. In the alternative, petitioners asserted that “as a cumulative result of his receipt of each and every vaccination between March 25, 2003 and February 22, 2005, Ryan has suffered . . . neuroimmunologically mediated dysfunctions in the form of asthma and ASD.On June 9, 2011, respondent filed a supplemental report pursuant to Vaccine Rule 4(c) stating it was respondent’s view that Ryan suffered a Table injury under the Vaccine Act – namely, an encephalitis within five to fifteen days following receipt of the December 19, 2003 MMR vaccine....Based on the record as a whole, the undersigned finds that the Proffer is reasonable and appropriate and that petitioners are entitled to an award as stated in the Proffer.'The full court paper can be found here:  http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/CAMPBELL-SMITH.MOJABI-PROFFER.12.13.2012.pdf

ASIA - New Syndrome Caused by Vaccine Adjuvants
The common immunogenic etiology of chronic fatigue syndrome: from infections to vaccines via adjuvants to the ASIA syndrome.Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is characterized by unexplained fatigue that lasts for at least 6 months with a constellation of other symptoms. Most cases start suddenly, and are usually accompanied by a flu-like illness. It is a symptom-based diagnosis of exclusion, the pathogenesis of which is unknown. Studies have examined and hypothesized about the possible biomedical and epidemiologic characteristics of the disease, including genetic predisposition, infections, endocrine abnormalities, and immune dysfunction and psychological and psychosocial factors. Recently, the AISA (autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants) syndrome was recognized, indicating the possible contribution of adjuvants and vaccines to the development of autoimmunity.Source: Infect Dis Clin North Am. 2011 Dec;25(4):851-63.

Empirical Data Confirm Autism Symptoms Related to Aluminum and Acetaminophen Exposure
Abstract: Autism is a condition characterized by impaired cognitive and social skills, associated with compromised immune function. The incidence is alarmingly on the rise, and environmental factors are increasingly suspected to play a role. This paper investigates word frequency patterns in the U.S. CDC Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) database. Our results provide strong evidence supporting a link between autism and the aluminum in vaccines. A literature review showing toxicity of aluminum in human physiology offers further support. Mentions of autism in VAERS increased steadily at the end of the last century, during a period when mercury was being phased out, while aluminum adjuvant burden was being increased. Using standard log-likelihood ratio techniques, we identify several signs and symptoms that are significantly more prevalent in vaccine reports after 2000, including cellulitis, seizure, depression, fatigue, pain and death, which are also significantly associated with aluminum-containing vaccines. We propose that children with the autism diagnosis are especially vulnerable to toxic metals such as aluminum and mercury due to insufficient serum sulfate and glutathione. A strong correlation between autism and the MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella) vaccine is also observed, which may be partially explained via an increased sensitivity to acetaminophen administered to control fever.Source:

Exposure to Mercury at 'Safe' Levels of Exposure Caused Death in Humans
Mercury (Hg) exposure is ubiquitous in modern society via vaccines, fish/crustacea, dental amalgam, food, water, and the atmosphere. This article examines Hg exposure in the context of primary exposure to pregnant women and secondary exposure experienced by their unborn babies. Babies in utero are particularly at risk of higher Hg exposure than adults (on a dose/weight basis through maternal Hg transfer via the placenta), and are more susceptible to adverse effects from mercury and its biologically active compounds. It is, therefore, critical that regulatory advisories around maximum safe Hg exposures account for pregnant women and secondary exposure that children in utero experience. This study focused on standardized embryonic and fetal Hg exposures via primary exposure to the pregnant mother of two common Hg sources (dietary fish and parenteral vaccines). Data demonstrated that Hg exposures, particularly during the first trimester of pregnancy, at well-established dose/weight ratios produced severe damage to humans including death. In light of research suggestive of a mercuric risk factor for childhood conditions such as tic disorders, cerebral palsy, and autism, it is essential that Hg advisories account for secondary prenatal human exposures.Source: Toxicological and Environmental Chemistry, Volume 94, issue 8, 2012.  http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02772248.2012.724574

Flu vaccine stickers rile nurses' union
Nurses who have been vaccinated for influenza should not be branded with a sticker to prove it, says the B.C. Nurses' Union says.
The union is challenging controversial regulations announced last week.
Union members met with the Health Employers Association of B.C. on Monday to discuss the new rules, which require frontline health-care staff to be vaccinated against the flu or wear a mask when treating patients.
Both the employers and the union agree that a higher rate of vaccinated workers would improve patient health and reduce influenza deaths, but the BCNU opposes the use of stickers to differentiate between those who are vaccinated and those who are not.
"We'd prefer that health-care workers don't have to wear information about their personal health history on their chest when at work," said Margaret Dhillon, BCNU executive councillor.

Vaccination error means new jabs for 220 children
MORE than 220 children and teenagers must undergo a new set of childhood vaccinations after it emerged the original jabs they received were not properly administered.
The error, which involved a number of vaccines and dates back to the late 1990s, may have left them without full protection against potentially serious diseases such as meningitis.
The 220 families, who were patients of the GP practice in Newcastle in west Dublin, were notified of the error by the Health Service Executive (HSE).
A HSE spokeswoman said: "The vaccines have not been prepared correctly and they may not have been effective."
She stressed that there are "no known safety issues" with the original vaccines.
The vaccines were given at one GP's surgery and the situation only came to light after a query by one of the children's parents. The HSE did not name the doctor involved or the location of his practice.
However, it is understood the doctor named in the letter received by parents is Dr Derek Graham, a GP in Newcastle. When contacted by the Irish Independent yesterday evening, a family member said Dr Graham would not be commenting.
Children receive a range of vaccines at different stages to protect against meningitis, mumps, whooping cough, pneumococcal disease, polio, German measles and tetanus.
The drug companies which make the vaccines have set out a series of stages which must be followed to ensure their effectiveness. They said they can only stand over vaccines which have been administered within the terms of the licence.

Marked Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Failure in 8-14 Year-olds in a North American Outbreak
Background: Despite widespread vaccination against Bordetella pertussis, disease remains prevalent. Acellular Pertussis vaccine may be less effective or durable than previously believed. Its clinical efficacy has yet to be evaluated in North America. At the epicenter of the largest outbreak in decades, we examined pertussis incidence and vaccine efficacy in a well-defined, vaccinated community. Methods: We reviewed 171 patients with a positive PCR for B. pertussis from March 1 to October 31, 2010 for demographics and vaccination status. Results: We found 132 cases of clinical pertussis in patients age <19, with peak incidence in ages 8-14. Testing rate peaked in infants, but remained nearly constant in other ages. The case rate markedly increased after age 7, peaking at age 12 and appeared to correlate to an increased interval since vaccination. Unvaccinated children accounted for very few cases. Conclusions: The 2010 pertussis outbreak was an excellent natural experiment to assess the American acellular pertussis vaccine. In a well-defined population with excellent ascertainment, minimized selection bias and known vaccination status, acellular boosters appear to be ineffective after 3 years. The sustaining population of the outbreak was fully immunized by national guidelines but more than 2.5 years since their last booster. Acellular pertussis boosters are effective but less durable than previously thought. Vaccine guidelines and pertussis control measures need to be reconsidered. Source: M. A. Witt - Res. Assistant, P.

Natural immunity is almost always lifelong.
High Levels of Vaccination Induces Substantial Numbers of Symptomatic Cases (Disease) and will Lead to Larger Epidemics
Abstract
For infectious diseases where immunization can offer lifelong protection, a variety of simple models can be used to explain the utility of vaccination as a control method. However, for many diseases, immunity wanes over time and is subsequently enhanced (boosted) by asymptomatic encounters with the infection. The study of this type of epidemiological process requires a model formulation that can capture both the within-host dynamics of the pathogen and immune system as well as the associated population-level transmission dynamics. Here, we parametrize such a model for measles and show how vaccination can have a range of unexpected consequences as it reduces the natural boosting of immunity as well as reducing the number of naive susceptibles. In particular, we show that moderate waning times (40-80 years) and high levels of vaccination (greater than 70%) can induce large-scale oscillations with substantial numbers of symptomatic cases being generated at the peak. In addition, we predict that, after a long disease-free period, the introduction of infection will lead to far larger epidemics than that predicted by standard models. These results have clear implications for the long-term success of any vaccination campaign and highlight the need for a sound understanding of the immunological mechanisms of immunity and vaccination.Source: Proc Biol Sci. 2009 Jun 7;276(1664):2071-80.

Vaccinated Hospital Worker May Have Exposed Hundreds to Pertussis
Providence Hospital officials say one of their own workers may have exposed hundreds of people to whooping cough, and now they're notifying employees and patients to get help immediately.Providence Regional Medical Center has been ground zero for the treatment of pertussis, or whooping cough. But this week it became ground zero for a new potential outbreak.Doctor Ahmet Tural is the head of infectious disease at the hospital. He said a hospital employee went to the staff clinic last week complaining of a nasty cough. He was sent home as a precaution, and on Monday his test results came back positive for whooping cough."He probably had it for about two weeks or slightly more, perhaps," Tural said.That means the employee had two weeks of direct contact with patients and fellow employees at the hospital. Officials believe at least 53 employees have been exposed to the illness, but that number could end up being more than 300 after factoring in patients and visitors.The hospital has been proactive."If they had direct exposure, then we automatically require them to be put on antibiotics," said Providence official Teresa Wenta.The worker in question thought he had been proactive, too. He was vaccinated against pertussis, but it wasn't effective.Tural said sometimes the vaccination just doesn't work."In 20, 25, 30 percent of the cases it may not be fully protective," he said.Source: Komo News, 4th July 2012.  http://www.komonews.com/news/local/161381365.html
75.8% of People in Pertussis Epidemic Fully Vaccinated
Since mid-2011, a substantial rise in pertussis cases has been reported in the state of Washington. In response to this increase, the Washington State Secretary of Health declared a pertussis epidemic on April 3, 2012. By June 16, the reported number of cases in Washington in 2012 had reached 2,520 (37.5 cases per 100,000 residents), a 1,300% increase compared with the same period in 2011 and the highest number of cases reported in any year since 1942. To assess clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory factors associated with this increase, all pertussis cases reported during January 1–June 16, 2012, were reviewed. Consistent with national trends, high rates of pertussis were observed among infants aged <1 year and children aged 10 years. However, the incidence in adolescents aged 13–14 years also was increased, despite high rates of vaccination with tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine, suggesting early waning of immunity. The focus of prevention and control efforts is the protection of infants and others at greatest risk for severe disease and improving vaccination coverage in adolescents and adults, especially those who are pregnant. Pertussis vaccination remains the single most effective strategy for prevention of infection.
Vaccination Status
The vaccination status of patients was determined by review of medical records and by patient or parent report. Vaccination was considered up-to-date if the minimum number of doses by age had been received, as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (2). Patients with invalid dose dates (e.g., date of dose preceding date of birth) were excluded from the vaccination status analysis. Individual doses were excluded if administered <14 days before symptom onset.
Valid vaccination history was available for 1,829 of 2,006 (91.2%) patients aged 3 months–19 years. Overall, 758 of 1,000 (75.8%) patients aged 3 months–10 years were up-to-date with the childhood diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) doses. Receipt of Tdap was documented in 97 of 225 (43.1%) patients aged 11–12 years and in 466 of 604 (77.2%) patients aged 13–19 years. Estimated DTaP coverage in Washington among children aged 19–35 months was 93.2% for ≥3 doses and 81.9% for ≥4 doses in 2010; Tdap coverage in adolescents aged 13–17 years was estimated at 70.6% (3).

Italian Court Gives 1.8 Million Payout after DT Vaccine Leaves Woman's Daughter in a Coma for 24 Years
This article is translated poorly by google translate:For 24 years a child, who has now become a woman of 29, residing
in the valley of Susa, in Turin, is in a coma for the failure of a
physician who does not administer a drug after a compulsory
vaccination. Her mother, Antonella Scarpanti, who is now 46 years
old, could no longer work and was abandoned by her husband. Intent 'a
civil suit against the health authority, but after years on the court
of first instance ruled against. In recent days, however, the Court
of Appeal ordered the Piedmont Region, the successor to the dissolved
healthcare company, to compensate it with 1.8 million plus interest
and legal fees. "It's compensation records, never granted for reasons
like this - explain the legal pool that has assisted the woman during
these years - and a sentence that states the company's liability for
error of health practitioners, who in this case is deceased in the
meantime. " The pediatrician - a second expert witness - not
administer 'of cortisone in the five days following vaccination and
after the onset of shock. The drug would prevent the entry into a
vegetative state after a diphtheria-tetanus which had been submitted
in the local health clinics in 1988, when she was five.
The girl's family lived in Bussoleno (Turin). Immediately after the
vaccination that had been made of the dissolved local health clinics
in 36, the girl had experienced high fever, leg pain, headache and
diarrhea. The doctor refused to administer drugs and the clinical
picture worsened until she entered the small vegetative state in which  she remains today. After the judgment, the mother is "on cloud nine,
but exhausted after 24 years of this life," says Antonella Scarpanti.
"I can not gloat after all I had to endure and suffer because they
dragged on for years, a situation that should be terminated
immediately. My child was very healthy and instead I had to live with
a brain-damaged. Now - ends - the compensation makes me more calm for the fact that if something happens to me, someone will be able to look after her. " This judgment - the lawyers say Renato Ambrosio, Stefano Bertone Marco Bona and the law firm and Commodus Ambrosio, who witnessed her mother - has restored dignity to the mother after years of suffering and economic problems. That process was a very difficult time for her and for us, but winning on appeal repay us for all their suffering. " The judgment makes the lawyers' quite satisfied in terms of the law, because, for the second time in Italy, recognized the principle that the healthcare organization meets the
error of the practitioner.
Economic standpoint we met only partially, because for example
established a compensation of only 5,000 per year for non-work
potential of a little girl when she grew up. " To pay the sum will be
subject to appeal to the Supreme Court, the Piedmont Region, "because - lawyers argue - after the disappearance of local health and training of local health services, the region is taking over 'all debts of the USL, including accumulated after their breakup. We hope
- concluded - that there is an action that would slip compensation
for other years: Our client is poor and has already made many
sacrifices over a long period in which was the sole support for her daughter. " Source: La Stampa.it, 13th July 2012.  http://www3.lastampa.it/torino/sezioni/cronaca/articolo/lstp/462317/
Chinese Government Sends Dad to Labour Camp for Complaining about His Son's Vaccine Injury
A court in the Chinese capital has upheld the sentencing of the father of a child sickened by a tainted tuberculosis vaccine to five months in labour camp after he repeatedly campaigned for public acknowledgement of the problem.The Beijing Intermediate People's Court upheld the sentence of five months' "re-education through labour" handed to parent activist Yang Yukui on Tuesday, during a brief closed-doors session with no trial, his wife said.The couple's five-year-old son Yang Xinhao has been in and out of hospital ever since being given a bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination shortly after birth, they say."There was no trial, just a sentence," said Yang's wife, Zhou Suying, who attended the sentencing. "The original sentence of five months was upheld [on appeal]."Yang's detention came during one of several trips to the Beijing Children's Hospital to try to persuade staff to address his son's problem after the child developed strange swellings across his body following a BCG vaccination for tuberculosis.Yang Xinhao experienced widespread swelling of his lymph nodes following the jab, according to his parents.The problem appears to be commonly reported in China.Source: Healthcare Today, 2nd September 2011.  Full article here:http://www.healthcare-today.co.uk/news/labour-camp-for-vaccine-dad/19604/

MMR: A Mother's Victory. Italian Court Rules MMR Caused Valentino's Autism
At nine months old, Valentino Bocca was as bright as a button. In a favourite family photo, taken by his father, the baby boy wriggles in his mother’s arms and laughs for the camera.
His parents look at the precious picture often these days. It is a reminder of their only son before they took him on a sunny morning to the local public health clinic for a routine childhood vaccination.
Valentino was never the same child after the jab in his arm. He developed autism and, in a landmark judgment, a judge has ruled that his devastating disability was provoked by the inoculation against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR).

Soldier Wins His Battle Not to Be Imprisoned For Refusing Vaccines
Soldiers, you ARE LEGALLY ALLOWED to refuse vaccines so if the military force them on you they are BREAKING THE LAW!
My name is Sean Niemi and until April 2nd, 2012 I was a Combat Medic with the United States Army. I served Honorably and Proudly for almost 7 years through 27 months worth of 2 Combat deployments. Iraq in 2006-2007 and Afghanistan in 2009.The end of my Military career came almost a year and a half earlier than I expected. I was preparing for an upcoming Combat Deployment (would have been my 3rd such deployment) when I decided that I was going to exercise my right to choose to not be vaccinated in accordance with current Army regulations. I had been wrestling with the decision for years at that point and decided that it was time to speak up and submit my Religious Exemption request. Almost immediately, I was told that no such exemption existed and that I was in violation of Army regulations regarding deployment readiness. I was told to take some time to research my options and come back with a decision as to what I wanted to do after the Christmas Holiday block leave time. I took that time to locate the exact Army Regulation that dealt with such exemption requests. AR 40-562 entitled “Immunizations and Chemoprophylaxis” stated that I did, indeed have the right to request exemption from immunizations, vaccines and any other medical treatment that ran counter to my religious beliefs.When I presented this evidence to my Chain of Command, I was told that it didn’t apply due to the upcoming deployment.  From that point on, I was regularly ridiculed, spoken down to, passed over for promotions and awards and, on at least one occasion, threatened with violence to myself and another fellow medic.  The threat took the form of my superior saying that he wished he could take myself and the other medic, lock us in a wall-locker and throw in a live grenade with the pin pulled. I understand frustration and that he has stated after the fact that he was just “blowing off steam” and it was “just a joke”, but, fratricide is nothing to be taken lightly or joked about. It was this type of toxic leadership that I believe permeated the Unit and was the driving influence in his decision to reject my exemption request and subsequently order me to get all necessary vaccines and immunizations required for deployment (which, incidentally, consisted of an influenza mist inhaler and a yearly Anthrax booster shot). When I respectfully refused that order due to the fact that I firmly believed it to be an unlawful and immoral order that undermined my Constitutionally protected religious rights I was informed that I would be facing UCMJ punishment effective immediately (which could consist of as much as 1 year in Military Prison, Dishonorable Discharge and a Felony Conviction on my record).I have endured distrust, name-calling, ridicule, career assassination, the threat of a possible felony conviction with 1 year of Military prison time, unimaginable stress put upon my family and on at least one occasion… death threats. I decided that I would not give up my fight for my personal rights. After more than 1 year of Court Martial proceedings, multiple depositions, and countless motions submitted by the Military Prosecutors and my Defense team I was finally Honorably discharged with most of my Veteran’s benefits intact on the grounds that the US Army could not accommodate my religious practices and as such I did not meet the needs of the Army.

10,000 Students Refuse to Enroll in Austin Community College Because of it's Policy to Exclude Unvaccinated Students

Meanwhile, a Washington State rock band named The Refusers is storming Youtube with their latest hit "First do no harm. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9y4Pq7lXAwVaccine refusal is a basic human right that has been often challenged by the pro-vaccine "authorities" from the local well-meaning pediatrician to the government officials all the way down to the school administrators. Even though no school or other agency can force anyone to take a vaccination, policies are written to give the distinct impression that the inoculations are compulsory. Any school administrator who says a student will be refused enrollment without a vaccine is lying.Enrollment at ACC has declined 15 percent since January, cancelling some 500 classes. When asked why, a huge number of the students are citing the institution's aggressive vaccination policy as their reason to drop out. A similar pattern of this anti vaccine revolt is being seen across the country.

BMJ Discussing Whether to Force Parents to Vaccinate...Here is Part of Article that Hitler Would Be Proud of
In a better world, vaccine mandates wouldnt be necessary. Parents would educate themselves about the diseases that vaccines prevent and learn that measles causes pneumonia and brain damage, mumps causes deafness and sterility, rubella causes severe birth defects, pertussis causes suffocation, and human papillomavirus (HPV) causes cervical, oropharyngeal, and anal cancers. They would learn about the remarkable safety and effectiveness of vaccines. And they would learn that although vaccines are not free of risk, their benefits clearly outweigh their risks. Mostly, they would learn that vaccines stand on a mountain of scientific evidence. Well informed: the choice to vaccinate their children would be an easy one.
Unfortunately, we dont live in that world. In our world, science based information is often obscured by false and misleading claims readily available in newspaper and magazine articles, on radio and television

Italian Court Finds MMR Causes Autism!
Basic google translation from Italian:
This judgment No. 2010/148, part No. 2010/0474, journal.n ° 2012/886, gave the appeal lodged by parents against the Department of Health, who demanded the payment of compensation for irreversible complications caused by a vaccine.
Le vaccin en question est le ROR . The vaccine is MMR. Selon les parents, en fait, les symptômes de l'autisme de leur fils sont vraiment apparus à la suite de l'inoculation. According to parents, in fact, symptoms of autism in their son did appear after inoculation.
Et vraiment le jour même, comme lu dans le jugement . And really the same day, as read in the judgment . Au retour du dispensaire de Riccione, le 26 mars 2004, l'enfant a commencé à manifester des symptômes préoccupants (diarrhée et nervosité) puis entre 2004 et 2005 sont survenus des signes de grave détresse psycho-physique jusqu'à la reconnaissance, le 7 août 2007, de l'invalidité totale et permanente à 100%. Return to the clinic in Riccione, March 26, 2004, the child began to show troubling symptoms (diarrhea and nervousness) and then between 2004 and 2005 occurred signs of severe psychological distress to physical recognition, 7 August 2007, the total and permanent disability to 100%.
That it was told the vaccination, the specialist Niglio had already stated in June 2008 and the confirmation came a year later by the specialist Montanari. Le lien, selon le jugement est donc « établi ». Jusqu'à condamner le ministère de la Santé à payer une indemnité . The link, in the judgment is "established." Up condemn the Ministry of Health to pay compensation.
Le jugement a provoqué une « grande confusion » entre les experts du Conseil Scientifique du Calendrier Vaccinal pour la Vie, qui rassemble des personnalités de hauts rangs de l'Hygiène et de la Santé Publique, de la Médecine Générale, de la Pédiatrie régionale-hospitalière et universitaire chapeautant la Société Italienne de l'Hygiène, de la Médecine Préventive et de la Santé Publique (SItI), la Fédération Italienne des Médecins de Médecine Générale (Fimmg), la Fédération Italienne des Médecins Pédiatres (Fimp) et la Société Italienne de Pédiatrie (Sip). The judgment has caused "great confusion" between the experts of the Scientific Council of the immunization schedule for Life, which brings together people with high ranks of Hygiene and Public Health, General Practice, the Regional Pediatric Hospital- university umbrella and the Italian Society of Hygiene, Preventive Medicine and Public Health (ITIS), the Italian Federation of General Practice Doctors (Fimmg), the Italian Federation of Paediatricians Doctors (FIMP) and the Italian Society of Pediatrics (Sip)..........
Finally, to prevent this negative judgment set a precedent on professional dynamics, the Council hopes that the Ministry of Health, as an advocate in the case which led to the controversial judgment of first instance, will appeal to the Court of Bologna. A cette fin, les membres du Conseil se rendent « disponibles à aider le bureau du Procureur Général à fournir conseils et littératures scientifiques valables pour souligner en particulier l'incapacité de cette vaccination spécifique à créer des antécédents provocant l'autisme». To this end, Council members will make "available to assist the Attorney General's office to provide advice and valid scientific literature to highlight in particular the failure of this specific vaccination to create provocative history of autism."

Conflicts of Interest in Vaccine Research
How safe are vaccines? Health officials caution that no vaccine is 100% safe, but they sponsor studies that conclude the benefits of vaccines far outweigh the risks. Yet conflicts of interest (COls) cloud the study of adverse effects of
vaccines, and public skepticism about vaccine safety information is widespread(ASTHO, 2010). Investigation into the possible link between childhood vaccines and autism provides an illustration of the competing interests that sponsors of vaccine safety research face that could affect their objectivity in choosing
which studies to support. Much research is sponsored by vaccine manufacturers
and public health bodies, who have financial and bureaucratic interests that could impede the objective study of vaccine safety.

Police Burst into School in Kerachi and Force Vaccinate Little 4 Year Old's at Gunpoint!!
A group of small children lined up in a colourful room of a private school on Wednesday morning and waited for a burqa-clad woman to force red polio drops down their throats. This was part of the three-day anti-polio campaign, which ended on a bitter note as the administrative staff of private schools around the city complained about being harassed and subjected to aggressive behaviour.
Private schools were asked to cooperate with the government teams administering polio vaccinations to students under the age of five years or go to jail. We were harassed by the polio teams and were forced to let them administer drops to our students, said the principal of AMI Schools nursery branch, Nasira Faiz. We are not the parents of these students. We cannot give permission to these teams to administer polio drops.
Our schools are located in safe areas. How can people barge in with guns? There was no condition in the notice that if we dont attend, we would be arrested, said Rabea Minai, a teacher. We are against this aggressive attitude.
According to the deputy commissioner, under section 186 of the Pakistan Penal Code, they have the right to take the action and arrest those who disobeyed government orders.
Private schools say that they cant let the children get vaccinated without the parents consent, he said. We dont need the permission. It is the basic human right of every child under the age of five to get vaccinated.

Pertussis DNA all over Vaccine Clinics, Nurse's Computers, and Surfaces!
A cluster of suspected whooping cough cases in Colorado was actually most likely a "pseudo-outbreak," according to an investigation by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
The cases, reported in the summer of 2009, seem to have been mistakenly diagnosed when patients' test samples became contaminated at one medical clinic. However, the CDC says, a cluster of whooping cough cases from the winter before likely was a true outbreak.
In the U.S., most children are immunized against whooping cough with the DTaP vaccine, which is given as a series of shots starting at the age of 2 months.
But cases still occur. According to the CDC, 27,550 cases were reported nationwide in 2010, with many more probably going unreported. There were also 27 deaths, nearly all in infants younger than one year.
Many of the suspected infections were also in people who'd been vaccinated.
People diagnosed in the summer were more likely to have only small amounts of pertussis DNA in their test samples -- which suggested the samples may have been contaminated.
Indeed, the CDC found pertussis DNA on surfaces at the clinic where most of the cases were seen. Of the sites the team swabbed -- from nurses' laptops to sinks to glove containers -- 61 percent had detectable pertussis DNA.
The researchers suspect that pertussis DNA from vaccines contaminated clinic surfaces, and then contaminated samples taken from patients to be sent to out for testing.

Officials are Changing the Definition of Autism to Make Case Rates Go Down!!
The New York Times has what sounds like a bombshell story on autism: The American Psychiatric Association is poised to narrow the definition of the disorder so far fewer people would be considered autistic. The kicker quote from the Yale author of an analysis on the subject: "The proposed changes would put an end to the autism epidemic. We would nip it in the budthink of it that way. (Another expert quoted thinks he's overstating the case.) If the changes go through, however, they could make it harder for people who fall short of the new qualifications to get treatment.

Autism is Encephalitis and is Reversible (1981 article)
n seeking the neurologic substrate of the autistic syndrome of childhood, previous studies have implicated the medial temporal lobe or the ring of mesolimbic cortex located in the mesial frontal and temporal lobes. During an acute encephalopathic illness, a clinical picture developed in three children that was consistent with infantile autism. This development was reversible. It was differentiated from acquired epileptic aphasia, and the language disorder was differentiated from aphasia. One child had rises in serum herpes simplex titers, and a computerized tomographic (CT) scan revealed an extensive lesion of the temporal lobes, predominantly on the left. The other two, with similar clinical syndromes, had normal CT scans, and no etiologic agent was defined. These cases are examples of ah acquired and reversible autistic syndrome in childhood, emphasizing the clinical similarities to bilateral medial temporal lobe disease as described in man, including the Klüver-Bucy syndrome seen in postencephalitic as well as postsurgical states.

Autism Could Be Caused By Genetic Susceptibility to Mercury (in Vaccines)
Pink disease (infantile acrodynia) was especially prevalent in the first half of the 20th century. Primarily attributed to exposure to mercury (Hg) commonly found in teething powders, the condition was developed by approximately 1 in 500 exposed children. The differential risk factor was identified as an idiosyncratic sensitivity to Hg. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have also been postulated to be produced by Hg. Analogous to the pink disease experience, Hg exposure is widespread yet only a fraction of exposed children develop an ASD, suggesting sensitivity to Hg may also be present in children with an ASD. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that individuals with a known hypersensitivity to Hg (pink disease survivors) may be more likely to have descendants with an ASD. Five hundred and twenty-two participants who had previously been diagnosed with pink disease completed a survey on the health outcomes of their descendants. The prevalence rates of ASD and a variety of other clinical conditions diagnosed in childhood (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, epilepsy, Fragile X syndrome, and Down syndrome) were compared to well-established general population prevalence rates. The results showed the prevalence rate of ASD among the grandchildren of pink disease survivors (1 in 25) to be significantly higher than the comparable general population prevalence rate (1 in 160). The results support the hypothesis that Hg sensitivity may be a heritable/genetic risk factor for ASD.

Used Vaccine Vials are Classed as Hazardous Waste
"In addition to the multidose vaccines containing thimerosal discussed above, some companies offer a 0.5 mg/L single dose, pre-filled syringe vaccine. Some of these products are labeled preservative- or thimerosal-free. Preservative-free products may contain trace amounts (less than or equal to 1 microgram/0.5 mL dose) because thimerosal was used during the manufacturing process. The term preservative- or thimerosal-free can be utilized if the manufacturer further purified the product, leaving only trace amounts (less than or equal to 1 microgram/0.5 mL) per dose. Even at this level, calculations indicate mercury would exceed the TCLP standard; therefore these vaccines, if deemed unusable, should be managed as hazardous waste as well."

Going into Hospital Carries a 1 in 300 Chance of Death
Millions of people die each year from medical errors and infections linked to health care and going into hospital is far riskier than flying, the World Health Organization said on Thursday.
"If you were admitted to hospital tomorrow in any country... your chances of being subjected to an error in your care would be something like 1 in 10. Your chances of dying due to an error in health care would be 1 in 300," Liam Donaldson, the WHO's newly appointed envoy for patient safety, told a news briefing.
This compared with a risk of dying in an air crash of about 1 in 10 million passengers, according to Donaldson, formerly England's chief medical officer.

Infant mortality rates regressed against number of vaccine doses routinely given: Is there a biochemical or synergistic toxicity?
The infant mortality rate (IMR) is one of the most important indicators of the socio-economic well-being and public health conditions of a country. The US childhood immunization schedule specifies 26 vaccine doses for infants aged less than 1 yearthe most in the worldyet 33 nations have lower IMRs. Using linear regression, the immunization schedules of these 34 nations were examined and a correlation coefficient of r = 0.70 (p < 0.0001) was found between IMRs and the number of vaccine doses routinely given to infants. Nations were also grouped into five different vaccine dose ranges: 1214, 1517, 1820, 2123, and 2426. The mean IMRs of all nations within each group were then calculated. Linear regression analysis of unweighted mean IMRs showed a high statistically significant correlation between increasing number of vaccine doses and increasing infant mortality rates, with r = 0.992 (p = 0.0009). Using the Tukey-Kramer test, statistically significant differences in mean IMRs were found between nations giving 1214 vaccine doses and those giving 2123, and 2426 doses. A closer inspection of correlations between vaccine doses, biochemical or synergistic toxicity, and IMRs is essential.

Kids Need to Be Tested for HIV After Flu Vaccine Blunder
Parents whose children got flu shots at a clinic in Fort Collins are being told their children should be tested for blood borne illnesses after an employee at the clinic mistakenly re-used syringes of medicine.
Its serious enough that a physician at Med Peds Clinic says the medical assistant who was giving the flu vaccines was immediately fired after someone else in the office noticed that vaccine from the same plastic syringes was being given to two different children.
A letter to parents says the risk of a disease like hepatitis or HIV being transmitted is very low.
Elena Gjini is 11 months old and looks healthy as can be. But now her father, Orges Gjini, is worried sick after receiving the letter and a phone call from the Med Peds Clinic recommending that some of their youngest patients, including Elena, be tested.
At 11 months, being put at risk for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV, thats something no parent should have to hear, Orges said.
In the letter Med Peds says a medical assistant using prefilled syringes mistakenly gave children half a dose.
She then removed the needle (using sterile procedure), replaced it with a new, unused, sterile needle and placed the syringes into a box labeled second doses, the letter states.
The half-filled syringes were then used on some patients returning for their second flu vaccine. The clinic consulted state health officials and told parents we have been assured that the risk of your child acquiring any infectious disease is very low.
It says its a very low risk, but any risk is too much, Orges said.
We are extremely dismayed by these events and are very sorry for any trouble or distress this may cause you, the letter states.
There is no way of calming down a parent by just saying that the risk is really low, Orges said. Theyve placed a child at a grave risk to where she may have contracted HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C, but the risk is very low so dont worry too much about it. It just doesnt work that way.
Now after getting her blood tested, Elenas father is waiting for the results.

Autism and Vaccines Researcher for CDC, Indicted for Fraud and Money-Laundering
SafeMinds demands long-overdue independent review of vaccine/autism research for data manipulation and conflicts of interest. Vaccine safety remains questionable.
Poul Thorsen, the principal coordinator of multiple studies funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) used to deny a vaccine/autism link was indicted on April 13th on 13 counts of fraud and 9 counts of money-laundering. The charges relate to funding for work he conducted for the CDC, which claimed to disprove associations between the mercury-based vaccine preservative, thimerosal, and increased rates of autism.
SafeMinds first voiced concerns in 2003 regarding a series of epidemiology studies out of Denmark and under the jurisdiction of Thorsen that provided the basis for the Institute of Medicine's claim that there was no association between thimerosal and autism. That claim has been responsible for the continued unsafe use of mercury in influenza vaccines in the United States and infant vaccines around the world.

Statement from Andrew Wakefield
Dr. Andrew Wakefield issued the following statement today on the recent British Medical Journal articles:
"The British Medical Journal and reporter Brian Deer recently alleged that my 1998 research paper was 'a hoax' and 'an elaborate fraud' and that my motivation was profit.
"I want to make one thing crystal clear for the record  my research and the serious medical problems found in those children were not a hoax and there was no fraud whatsoever. Nor did I seek to profit from our findings.
"I stand by the Lancet paper's methodology and the results which call for more research into whether environmental triggers cause gastrointestinal disease and developmental regression in children. In fact, despite media reports to the contrary, the results of my research have been duplicated in five other countries (to see citations to studies, visit http://tinyurl.com/4hrdt5y.)
"It is not unexpected to see poor reporting and misinformation coming from Brian Deer, the lead reporter of the recent BMJ coverage. But to see coverage in other media that cites Deer's shoddy journalism in the BMJ as a final justification to claim there is no link between vaccines and autism is ludicrous. The MMR is only one vaccine of the eleven vaccinations on the pediatric schedule that has been studied for causing developmental problems such as autism. That is fact, not opinion. Any medical professional, government official or journalist who states that the case is closed on whether vaccines cause autism is jumping to conclusions without the research to back it up.
"I continue to fully support more independent research to determine if environmental triggers, including vaccines, are causing autism and other developmental problems. The current rate of autism is 1 in 110 children in the United States and 1 in 64 children in the U.K. My goal has always been and will remain the health and safety of children. Since the Lancet paper, I have lost my job, my career and my country. To claim that my motivation was profit is patently untrue. I will not be deterred - this issue is far too important."

BMJ Letters Regarding the Witch Hunt of Andrew Wakefield
It is most unfortunate to read the Andrew Wakefield episode, the physician being demonised for linking MMR vaccines with autism. In my opinion, he has erred on the side of caution, despite lack of appropriate scientific rigor, or accusations of fraud. A quick PubMed search shows that at least 500 articles relate vaccines with autism, with some suggesting that "U.S. male neonates vaccinated with the hepatitis B vaccine prior to 1999 (from vaccination record) had a threefold higher risk for parental report of autism diagnosis compared to boys not vaccinated as neonates during that same time period (Gallagher CM, Goodman MS.J Toxicol Environ Health A. 2010 Jan;73(24):1665-77). Other hypotheses suggest that the "combination measles-mumps-rubella vaccine causes autism by damaging the intestinal lining, which allows the entrance of encephalopathic proteins; (2) thimerosal, an ethylmercury-containing preservative in some vaccines, is toxic to the central nervous system; and (3) the simultaneous administration of multiple vaccines overwhelms or weakens the immune system" (Gerber JS, Offit PA..Clin Infect Dis. 2009 Feb 15;48(4):456-61.Vaccines and autism: a tale of shifting hypotheses)In Canada, researchers estimated the prevalence of pervasive developmental disorder with respect to MMR vaccination in 27,749 children from 55 schools in Quebec (Fombonne E, Zakarian R, Bennett A, Meng L, McLean- Heywood D. Pervasive developmental disorders in Montreal, Quebec, Canada: prevalence and links with immunizations. Pediatrics. 2006;118:e139-50).
Although 20 epidemiologic studies have shown that neither thimerosal nor MMR vaccine causes autism, it is not clear if the vaccine is entirely safe if used in the wrong way (any controlled studies?). And Dr.Wakefield's publications might have only highlighted the pitfalls associated with abuse of MMR vaccines in particular and vaccines in general. He has erred but only on the side of caution given the myriad biotech and pharmaceutical products out there, not one of which is entirely safe and efficacious. After all, it is a question of risk-benefit analysis, and if in some cases the risk is overhyped or exaggerated, it should not be a cause for concern. It is something to be appreciated, instead, despite all the missed childhood vaccinations!

Misdirection with vaccine investigations
I have documented the epidemic of autism from 1992/1993 using the US Department of Education figures. Also I have found through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request from the Social Security Administration that nationwide in the US, the numbers of adults/children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) collecting Social Security (SSI) benefits has skyrocketed from around 42,000+ in 2002 to 111,000+ in 2008.
In New Jersey, the state Division of Developmental Disabilities estimates nearly a quarter of 40,000 people it serves have autism as at least one of their diagnoses. Nationally, more than 250,000 students with autism were in schools in 2006-07, more than a 600 percent increase over a decade, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. And a 2007 National Survey of Child Health estimated that more than 680,000 children aged 2 to 17 have some form of autism -- a rate of 1 out of every 91 children.
In deed, I would think it would be more important to find out how the medical community could stop this epidemic by prevention and treat the children and adults that have regressive autism like our son. If it isn't done, all the denials about vaccines and autism will not stop this epidemic and it will be costly not only in economic terms but human terms.

Vaccine Damage
It can reasonably be assumed that some vaccines do cause damage to children or we would not have the Vaccine Damage Payments Act 1979. [1] The list of diseases to which this act applies includes measles and rubella as well as diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough.
There does not appear to have been a consolidated paper that attempts to show how vaccines might cause brain damage by a review of the scientific literature except for the one that I have published on various web sites including scribd. [2] It has been published for open access. This paper looks at the causative factors mainly from the effects of the whooping cough vaccine (pertussis).
However, the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Immunization Program, promulgates that the risks from MMR vaccine can be permanent brain damage. [3]
Epidemiologists will probably say, and quite rightly, that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the occasional damage that is caused by some of them. The number of payments for vaccine damage in the UK is in excess of 1,000 and compared with the number of children who have benefitted, that number is miniscule bit not unimportant.
Over a thousand children will be living diminished lives as a result and their parents will be anguished that they were, in part, responsible for their child's disability.
For this lifetime of inequality and the loss of; normal education, a job and a life that contains the expectancies that most of us have envisaged and possibly achieved, the maximum award is, If you are severely disabled as a result of a vaccination, a one-off, tax-free payment of GBP120,000.
It is this shameful situation that ought to cause concern rather than a continuing denouncement of Wakefield. He may have got his understanding of the relationship between MMR and Autism wrong but that does not prove that there isn't one.

A Simple Study Could Settle This
I am a physician board-certified by American Board of Psychiatry & Neurology who has specialized in autism for the last 13 years. I have trained hundreds of other physicians in the biomedical treatment of autism, and regularly mentor actively practicing physicians. I and other physicians with whom I work have had many children in our practices with history of Hep B vaccine at birth followed by regression into autism after the live triple MMR vaccine. Almost every patient with autism has some degree of gut disorder, and those with high rubeola antibody titers often have had the most intractable gut inflammation conditions in my practice.
I have never questioned Dr. Wakefield's association between MMR, autism and what is aptly named autistic enterocolitis and personally do not believe he has acted fraudulently. Along with hundreds of other physicians with waiting lists trying to help these suffering children I believe this uproar could be easily settled by a good study comparing autistic children who received Hep B at birth and then MMR with neurotypical children who have never been vaccinated (who are plentiful). Maybe a physician who has made millions off of vaccines and is a highly vocal vaccine proponent would propose/conduct such a study; it is obvious why vaccine makers would not like to do so.

The Never-Vaccinated
Until and unless we compare the vaccinated to the never vaccinated, we will never know if vaccines, whether in general or specifically, result in better health outcomes for those who are administered them.
And forget the argument that people who don't vaccinate might be different and that might affect the results: If the never-vaccinated are healthier than the vaccinated, wouldn't we want to know it? We could then go about trying to understand why.
The failure to do such studies speaks volumes.
As far as using the excuse that there are limitations and difficulties with conducting such studies, fine. Don't do them. But stop pretending you know that the benefits of vaccines (far) outweigh the risks.
Finally, the hue and cry over the Wakefield paper is so out of proportion to the alleged wrongdoings, one has to wonder who's behind it and why it is happening.
If those who are claiming such egregious flaws really cared whether or not the Wakefield paper was fatally in err, they would do a properly designed and conducted retrospective study comparing those who have only gotten the MMR to those who have never been vaccinated at all. Only then might we get closer to the truth.
But that isn't going to happen, because there is no official interest in really knowing it.
So instead we get a smoke-screen designed to quell further debate and put the fear of God (or something) in anyone contemplating challenging the status quo.

Most Medical Trials are Invalid Due to Not Using Harmless Placebo
In a genuine medical trial, the medicinal product is supposed to be tested against a completely harmless substance, such as water or a sugar pill, however, in most trials a harmful placebo is given so that both sides have side-effects and it looks as if the medicine is safe.
For instance, the placebo in Gardasil trials was aluminium and this has many side-effects.
Now a review of medical studies has found that most of them are scientifically invalid:
No regulations govern placebo composition. The composition of placebos can influence trial outcomes and merits reporting.
Most studies did not disclose the composition of the study placebo. Disclosure was less common for pills than for injections and other treatments (8.2% vs. 26.7%; P = 0.002).
Limitation: Journals with high impact factors may not be representative.
Conclusion: Placebos were seldom described in randomized, controlled trials of pills or capsules. Because the nature of the placebo can influence trial outcomes, placebo formulation should be disclosed in reports of placebo-controlled trials.

Government scraps swine flu vaccination campaign for under fives
The Department of Health has revealed it is to scrap plans for healthy children under five to continue to be vaccinated against swine flu, just three months after urging GPs to vaccinate more than three million youngsters against the outbreak.
In a major U-Turn, the Chief Medical Officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, revealed the programme of vaccinating healthy children would wrap up at the end of next month, although GPs have been told to continue to try to vaccinate children until then.
Extending the vaccination campaign to children has proved a disappointment, with just 17% of children in England having had the vaccine according to the latest uptake figures.
GP leaders blamed protracted negotiations with the Government, which refused to provide concessions on GP workload via a national deal, for the lack of uptake in a campaign which ended up being launched as a hugely patchwork and bitter set of local arrangements between PCTs and GPs.
The move to scrap child vaccination against swine flu will also be seen as vindication by many GPs, with the majority of respondents to a Pulse poll in December claiming that it was a waste of NHS resources.
A spokesperson for the Department of Health said: The programme was extended to young healthy children because more people in this age group were hospitalised.
We want to ensure that the NHS has the opportunity to complete this programme of work so that all children in this age group can have the vaccine if their parents and carers wish.
Click here to find out more!
Following advice from JCVI, and given the low levels of swine flu virus circulating, the risk from the virus is lower for young children than the clinical risk groups so we will not be extending that part of the programme beyond the end of March.
It means GPs have an impossible task of vaccinating more than 2.5 million children in just over a month, with only 518,000 doses having been given to healthy children to date.
Dr Dean Marshall, a GPC negotiator on swine flu, said: I believe the take up of the vaccine among children would have been much greater had we not wasted several weeks in negotiations with the Government which meant the campaign did not get under way until after Christmas, by which time fears over the illness had lessened.'
The Government also revealed that just 32% of all target groups had been vaccinated in England, which confirms Pulse's predictions that the vast majority of GPs will fail to receive reduced thresholds in this year's patient survey, after the GPC's national deal based on vaccination of at risk groups aged between 5-65.
Sir Liam revealed overall figures for vaccination take up were far worse in England than other parts of the UK and elsewhere in Europe, adding: We continue to receive anecdotal accounts of people not being aware of their need and entitlement for vaccination or believing that vaccination clinics are unavailable.
It would be really helpful if you [GPs] were able to check whether awareness and access to the vaccine is high in your practice. That way we can ensure that this important protection is widely in place.

Some Interesting Comments From GP's!

It does make one wonder! Either the threat from swine flu to the under 5s is real - in which case the campaign to immunise them needs to be continued despite current low uptake **OR** the threat is not real, in which case it should stop now! Not in the surgery and not sure whether the LES (terms imposed by DH) was a target or IOS fee - but should a clinically necessary immunisation campaign depend on uptake? If so, why did we continue with MMR when the uptake was reduced by the autism scare?
* Stephen - Bury | 22 Feb 10
Why continue to vaccinate the under fives for another 5 weeks if it is no longer thought to be necessary based on risk vs benefit and how do we explain this to confused parents?
* chris | 22 Feb 10
So is there a risk or isn't there? If not, just stop now, if there is continue! The whole thing seems very wooly and lacking in evidence based arguments. The uptake in our area is low as letters from PCT have only gone out in the last month to invite children in. There does seem to be a lot of factors impeding the roll out of the vaccine when if we had had the go ahead we were all prepared to work hard and get it done for everyone before Xmas!

So why have some practices today recieved letters from DOH telling them to continue vaccinating all at risks and under 5's through spring and summer? Left hand/right hand or wrong information?

I am shocked by the spin of Sir Liam. Not long ago he dissed the pulse survey as being 'non-scientific' and pointed to another survey as being more scientific that suggested over 70% of parents would go for the vaccine. Of course the Pulse survey was very accurate and the other survey favoured by Sir Liam turned out to be complete rubbish. How can such an obvious spin doctor who ignores the observation of reality in favour of propaganda that the Third Reich would be proud of hope to continue? No wonder he has resigned. He can't go soon enough for me. Tip for his replacement - more hard science to back up your claims regarding the safety and efficacy of said vaccine and far less political spin and propaganda.

The biggest problem that we have had on the front line is that swine flu has only been a mild illness. It never lived upto the apocolyptic chaos originally portrayed - 65,000 deaths, food and infrastrucure shortages... Unfortunately the DoH had commited itself to 60 million doses of vaccine and a stockpile of Tamiflu due to expire in 2010. Lessons learnt:- 1.Pandemic doesn't = serious. Perhaps the old epidemiology definition needs to be restored. 2. If you can't convince and engage the healthcare teams of the value of vaccination then your stockpiles are going nowhere
* margaret | 26 Feb 10
The decision by the Department of Health to simply abandon the under fives swine flu vaccination programme begs more questions than it answers. For a start why are we supposed to continue to vaccinate children tikl the end of March - if the DH has carried out a careful cost-risk benefit analysis and decided it is no longer thought to be necessary. And how do we explain this to confused parents? I know the decision to stockpile the vaccine had to made quickly and at a time when it was far from clear how serious the pandemic was going to be. But what's changed since the decision was made to vaccinate children to now? Very little it seems. This decision seems to be based on financial expediencey rather than clinical judgment. Is 'well if noone wants it let's not bother anymore' a reasonable way to run a vaccination campaign? However - maybe it's a rather fitting way to end a rather ignominius chapter in the DH's history

Andrew Wakefield and the GMC Hearing - VAN UK'S Comment:
The GMC recently announced that Dr. Andrew Wakefield was dishonest, his study was false and he had a callous disregard for children.
VAN UK would like to point out that the case paper involving 12 children was NOT a study but a case paper and Dr. Wakefield asked that a study be undertaken to establish if there was a link between MMR, autism and bowel disease.
He also said that such a link at the time had not been 'proven', so the DOH's reaction has been a massive over-reaction and in our opinion, somewhat guilty.
A guilty party always goes on the defensive.
If the DOH were truly concerned about children dying from measles (and incidently, 96% of deaths are in the third world), then they would have continued to allow parents access to the single measles vaccine on the NHS.
The fact that they withdrew it, leaving a lot of pro-vaccine parents unwilling to vaccinate, would seem to us rather counter productive.
If you believe in vaccines as they do then any vaccine is better than none.
Ever since the publication of the 1998 case paper, the DOH have presented studies supposedly to 'prove' that MMR doesn't cause autism, instead of doing what they were supposed to, determining what DOES cause it and investigating the bowel symptoms of the children, most of whom are in serious pain.
One of the mother's of a child in the paper told me she cannot even take her child to the GP because they say to treat him would be 'too political' and when he has had serious medical events happen to him, the A+E staff have told her they will 'only treat the emergency, not the condition'.
These children have been dumped like hot potatoes and no one from the medical profession except Dr. Wakefield and his team have cared to help them.
Since when did politics come before pain and suffering?
The children - some of them now young adults - were not allowed to state their views on their treatment at the GMC hearing and for those who were too disabled to do so, their parents were denied the opportunity to speak for them.
Not one parent of the 12 children involved complained about Andrew Wakefield, in fact, some said he had been helping their children and relieving their pain.
It seems to us that it is the DOH who has a callous disregard for the wellbeing of children.
To retract a paper is not going to make the issue go away.
There have now been studies done in the US and court hearings showing a link between autism and vaccines and there has been a very recent paper (listed on the autism, mercury and vaccines page of this site) that replicated Andrew Wakefield's findings of bowel disease in autistic children.
If a doctor cannot even question something because it is against popular theory, that is not science and we feel that the Lancet has lost some of its credibility as a result.

Direct Rebuttal To Health Protection Scotland and Scottish Health Minister Nicola Sturgeon re Their Comments on Our Protests
Dear Health Protection Scotland
I would like to directly challenge you after you asserted in a newspaper article in the Scotsman, by Richard Bath, that my organisation was 'persuing a reckless cause' that would lead to the deaths of babies and mothers from swine flu, due to my organisation heading protests against the untested vaccine.
There is NO PROOF for your assertion that my organisation would do any such thing and ample proof that you, Health Protection Scotland, are being reckless with the lives of thousands of unborn infants and their mothers.
According to this NHS training pack for immunisers, here:
http://209.85.229.132/search?q=cache:RbuvyWzwBe4J:www.nes.scot.nhs.uk/hai/pandemic_flu/documents/H1N1v1.003-08-09.pdf+Celvapan+data+sheet&cd;=8&hl;=en&ct;=clnk&gl;=uk&client;=firefox-a
both vaccines, Pandemrix and Celvapan HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED for side-effects or contraindications so it is basically a big experiment and you have no idea if the patient you are injecting is contraindicated or what type of side-effects they might experience.
It has also NOT been tested on pregnant women so to recommend it for pregnant women is irresponsible, particularly when the Pandemrix version contains mercury which has been detected in evalated levels in autistic children (Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons Volume 8 Number 3 Fall 2003) and Merck, a vaccine manufacturer, say thimerosal can cause 'considerable damage to health and may even be lethal' -
http://www.vce.org/mercury/thimerosal-usp.pdf
My question would be why you are injecting a potentially lethal substance into a pregnant woman?
Another study found that even tiny injections of thimerosal can cause autism - 'As a result of the present findings, in combination with the brain pathology observed in patients diagnosed with autism, the present study helps to support the possible biological plausibility for how low-dose exposure to mercury from thimerosal-containing vaccines may be associated with autism' - (Induction of metallothionein in mouse cerebellum and cerebrum with low-dose thimerosal injection, Cell Biology and Toxicology, 0742-2091 (Print) 1573-6822 (Online), 9 April 2009).
The Journal of Pediatric Infectious Diseases also said that governments should bring in laws that prevent the use of thimerosal in vaccines - (Journal of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Volume 4, Number 3 / 2009) and in many other countries in the world, H1N1 vaccine is NOT recommended for pregnant women.
In fact, a data sheet for Afluria H1N1 vaccine shows that the vaccine SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PREGNANT OR NURSING MOTHERS and has not been tested in such groups:
Pregnancy Category C:
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine or AFLURIA.
It is also not known whether these vaccines can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity.
Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.
Neither Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine nor AFLURIA has been evaluated in nursing mothers.
It is not known whether Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine or AFLURIA is excreted in
human milk.
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine is administered to a nursing woman.'

Although this brand is not being used in the UK, they are all very similar H1N1 vaccines.
According to a 10 November government document, plans are in place to mandate H1N1 vaccine and exclude unvaccinated children from school -

This is a violation of human rights and since the drug is clearly experimental, admitted in the NHS document, it is against the nuremburg code.
The first directive of the nuremburg code states that:
'The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential. This means that the person involved should have legal capacity to give consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, over-reaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion; and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision. This latter element requires that before the acceptance of an affirmative decision by the experimental subject there should be made known to him the nature, duration, and purpose of the experiment; the method and means by which it is to be conducted; all inconveniences and hazards reasonable to be expected; and the effects upon his health or person which may possibly come from his participation in the experiment.' - (http://ohsr.od.nih.gov/guidelines/nuremberg.html).
So even suggesting that vaccines could be coerced is illegal.
The JCVI meeting minutes for 18 February 2009 said that they would only introduce influenza vaccines for pregnant women if it was cost effective and reduced respiratory disease in neonates:
'the vaccination of pregnant women was only likely to be cost-effective if there was evidence to suggest that vaccination in the late stages of pregnancy reduced influenza in neonates.' - http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@ab/documents/digitalasset/dh_097411.pdf
So in actual fact, they introduced a vaccine that had NO EVIDENCE of reducing disease in newborns and were only interested in introducing it if it made enough money.
It seems money is more important to this government than the health and wellbeing of mothers and their babies.
A report in Le Parisen newspaper in France told of a mother who lost her baby at term after being vaccinated and the baby had H1N1 in his tissues (Le Parisien, 14 December 2009) and another report in a Swedish paper told of a previously healthy mother who had a brain haemorrhage after vaccination and her baby had to be delivered two months early - http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article6283276.ab
There are dozens of women in the UK writing to the newspapers with similar stories, so you, Health Protection Scotland, are endangering the lives of many, and all for an illness that is as mild as normal flu.
If you look at NHS choices flu and swine flu pages, you will see the symptoms are exactly the same:
http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Flu/Pages/Symptoms.aspx
http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/pandemic-flu/Pages/Symptoms.aspx
Doctors are NOT taking swabs for this so they have no idea if the person actually has H1N1 or not and the person gets diagnosed over the phone without even being seen just to boost up swine flu notifications to encourage sales of your untested vaccine and misdiagnoses over the phone line have actually led to children dying of meningitis.
This for an illness that has killed far less than regular flu.
One in three people get cancer, yet you don't scream from the roof tops about how everyone is going to die in the same way you have done with swine flu.
You are highly irresponsible and put money, profit and government agenda ahead of the health of mothers and their babies.
You should be ashamed of yourself,

THIS LETTER HAS BEEN SENT TO HEALTH PROTECTION SCOTLAND, THE SCOTTISH HEALTH MINISTER AND THE SCOTSMAN NEWSPAPER.
NEITHER THE MINISTER NOR HEALTH PROTECTION SCOTLAND HAVE REPLIED AND TO MY KNOWLEDGE THE NEWSPAPER HAS NOT PRINTED MY REBUTTAL - 23/12/09.
UK Parliment Document Saying That They May Mandate Swine Flu Vaccine
Powers to impose compulsory vaccination
Most legal powers needed to manage a pandemic are provided under the Public Health Acts covering England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, which empower local authorities to require examination, hospitalisation, or isolation of infected persons, create a criminal offence relating to exposing others to risk of infection, and allow some controls over school attendance and playgrounds.
In other words, although local authorities cannot force people to be vaccinated under those powers, they can for example refuse to admit children to school unless they have been vaccinated.
However, the Government has extremely broad powers for tackling an emergency, in the Civil Contingencies Act 2004. This includes a special procedure for making regulations in an emergency, if existing legislation could not relied upon without the risk of serious delay, and various other conditions are met.
In particular:
22 Scope of emergency regulations
(1) Emergency regulations may make any provision which the person making the regulations is satisfied is appropriate for the purpose of preventing, controlling or mitigating an aspect or effect of the emergency in respect of which the regulations are made.
(2) In particular, emergency regulations may make any provision which the person making the regulations is satisfied is appropriate for the purpose of
(a) protecting human life, health or safety,
(b) treating human illness or injury,
Thus, if the situation became serious enough for compulsory vaccination to be considered necessary, regulations could be introduced under the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 and these could include penalties for non-compliance.

This is what we're up against!
If you value your right to choose, if you want to retain your right to say what is put into your body, even if you are pro vaccinations but think people have a right to accept or reject medical intervention, please get involved with our protests and write lobbying letters to your government official!

We Made The News!!
We're Having An Impact, People.
With Thanks To Claire Knox For Doing The Organising!
Demonstrators marched through Scotland's capital to protest against swine flu vaccination.
The group believe H1N1 is not as serious as it is claimed, and have concerns about the safety and usefulness of the vaccine.
Around 80 people took part in Saturday's march along Edinburgh's Royal Mile from St Giles' Cathedral to the Scottish Parliament.
