Info
Vital Signs: Representing AIDS
Vital Signs: Representing AIDS is an ongoing research project by Dr Sarah Graham that explores the various ways in which HIV and AIDS have been represented in a range of texts, including fiction, poetry, drama, memoir, film and visual art.
The launch event for the project was 'Spreading the Word: AIDS Posters from Around the World', an exhibition at the New Walk Museum, Leicester, from 15 July - 28 August 2011.
Further details of the exhibition and sample posters can be viewed on this site.
Sarah Graham teaches a module about AIDS Narratives on the MA in Modern Literature in the School of English.
Future initiatives in the Vital Signs project will be publicised here.
