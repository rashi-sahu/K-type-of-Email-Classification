Providing hypnotherapy training since 1984
The LCCH was created in 1984 to provide intending practitioners of hypnosis and hypnotherapy, as well as those with an interest in hypnosis / hypnotherapy, with the disciplines, skills and tuition necessary to practise hypnosis safely and ethically.
Our aim is to enable our students to deal safely, confidently and effectively with a very wide variety of physical and psychological symptoms. Practical skills’ training is an essential part of all LCCH hypnotherapy training courses.

Skill based training
Practical hypnotherapy skills training is an essential part of all LCCH hypnosis courses. The presentation of hypnotherapeutic techniques will be followed by a demonstration on a volunteer member of the class, and students will be required to practice each skill in small groups in order to gain experience of working with both receptive and resistant subjects. Practice sessions are always overseen by a senior lecturer and supervisor where appropriate.

I trained with the LCCH on all levels of training and I still believe they were the most enjoyable and effective training courses I have ever been on.
Three words to describe my university experience: Life-changing, inspirational and fun. My favourite aspects of the course were the practical side and also the variety of the lecturers that we had to teach us. This course has allowed me to change careers. I used to be a PA and now I’m a full-time Clinical Hypnotherapist.
Angel BrooksExcellent course!!!. I ‘ve never had so much fun learning something so valuable. A priceless tool that I can use in my life and to help others. I have applied it to myself and already noticed huge changes in my confidence.
Andrea LittlefairAs a person who has been treated for depression for 23 years, this course has given me numerous tools to deal with my own low self-esteem, confidence and the depression; and has made a huge difference to me personally. As a bonus, I feel well skilled to help others, as a therapist in the future.
Debbie YeatmanI have a clearer understanding of the model of psychological health. I have applied it in both my personal and professional life and I now live by these principles. My patients love it and are excited by these tools to tackle emotional disturbance. As a result I am getting more patients through word of mouth. It was an excellent course.
Pamela Wilkie DoveThis was the best course I have ever done. The lectures were consistently excellent and extremely enjoyable. I feel as if I have a far greater understanding of psychological problems and thus am no longer just applying techniques and hoping. The entire principles have already changed my entire approach to treating patients. I have applied what I have learned to myself and my patients. The effects have been profound and excellent. I enjoyed the environment and all the ‘ah ha’ moments.
Andrew MouleI absolutely loved the course! It was exactly what I was looking for. It ties in perfectly with much of my own research into personal development.
Roddy GalbraithExcellent, well run course – first class support from all the lecturers – in a caring, supportive environment. I feel very privileged to have had such excellent tutoring/assistance.
Vivian Beanland
Excellent! One of the best learning experiences of my life.
Dr Swati Kashyap Sharma
It opened my eyes to how counselling should be done, and how effective it is when strengthened with hypnotherapy. Very different to the form of counselling used in the NHS.
Darush Attar-Zadeh
The course has a very good and clear structure and first class lecturers that add to the overall excellent experience. I have really enjoyed it.
Karin MombergThe course was fantastic. The teaching and content of the course were excellent. I loved it. The best part was the practical side and being able to hypnotise people – being able to help people in that state. I am now setting up my own clinical hypnotherapy practice.
