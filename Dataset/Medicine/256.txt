Don’t get lost in cancer!
You stand out, your illness doesn’t!
My Name Is NOT Cancer is a cancer support organisation that encourages you to retain your identity despite the enormity of a cancer diagnosis. We understand how important it is to be your own person, with your own beliefs, dreams and ambitions for life. Cancer does not define you: you can still be you!
YOU STAND OUT… your illness doesn’t!
Celebrate your identity and let it define the real you.
Survivorship starts NOW!
No matter what challenges lie ahead, you are surviving every day!
Communication is key!
Be empowered to ask the questions that matter to you!
“We understand you were a person with a life before your diagnosis and you must believe you will still be you throughout your treatment and beyond. The struggle is being the person with a life separate from cancer whilst being in the grip of the illness.” - Fiona Fletcher, CEO My Name Is NOT Cancer.

Our mission
Helping people understand a little of what it is like to have cancer… and to not be defined by it.
You were a person with a life before diagnosis and will be after. The struggle is, in being the person with the life separate from cancer, while being in the grip of the illness.
