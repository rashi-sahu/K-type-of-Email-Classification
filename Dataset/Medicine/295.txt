Overton
Studios Trust is inspired by the teachings of Jesus.
We use Jesus'
teachings to heal people who suffer from any of the above conditions,
at both body and mind levels.
This
is a large website, so please relax, take your time and explore it
slowly and thoroughly.   If you, or a friend or a relative,
suffer
from ME or CFS or FM, I believe that we may be able help.
Overton Studios
Trust is founded on 'Therapeutic
Thinking'.
Therapeutic Thinking
comprises
'Body-management'
and 'Mind-management'.
Body-management
comprises thinking about and managing your body so as
to promote your health and wellbeing at a
profound biochemical and cellular level.
Mind-management
comprises thinking about and managing your mind so as
to promote your health and wellbeing at both your mind and your
body levels.
Medical
science has conclusively demonstrated that Therapeutic Thinking
not only
heals the mind but also promotes healing of the body
at a profound biochemical and cellular level.
Therapeutic Thinking
can
be taught and learned.
Our next video, 'Miracles,
Mind and ME'
will be about the Mind-management
of ME and is currently under
production.  Please join the OSTrust Club
if you wish to be informed when it is released.
