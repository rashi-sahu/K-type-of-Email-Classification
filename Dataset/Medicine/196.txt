Formerly the Hughes Syndrome Foundation
The Centre for Rheumatology at University College London has been awarded a £3.5 million grant from the Medical Research Council to continue developing a new treatment for antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), the largest grant ever awarded in the UK for research into APS.
The grant will support the next three years' work on the project designed to develop the new agent to the point where trials in humans could start.
Professor Anisur Rahman, a Trustee and Medical Advisor to APS Support UK, is leading the team at UCL who are working in partnership with Abzena, a biotechnology company that provides specialist chemical technology needed to develop this potential treatment.
