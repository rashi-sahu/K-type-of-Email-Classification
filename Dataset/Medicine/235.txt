APPG for 22q syndromes AGM - call for MPs support in 2017Hi everyone,
Firstly, BIG thank you to everyone who has taken part in our online surveys over the last year or so. It is now coming to fruition! We will shortly have a glossy report for the MPs at our AGM for the APPG for 22q syndromes later this month.
It would be really helpful if you could all write to your MP, I've attached a template on the left hand side under files but you can of course write what you want. This is the link to find your MP so you can email them or even phone them up!
Our current chair Jack Lopresti MP wants to stand down, and MPs generally are all over the shop with Brexit, party conferences and jockeying for better jobs. So we need a new chair... please do contact your MP! It's really important and your letter WILL make a difference. The APPG is a big coup for everyone affected by 22q11DS.
cheers!
Julie
