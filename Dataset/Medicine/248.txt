Welcome to the Mouth Cancer Foundation!
I founded the Mouth Cancer Foundation in June 2004 to be a professional support organisation solely dedicated to helping people with mouth, throat and other head and neck cancers deal with the crisis of cancer.
Through a variety of ways the charity gives resources, information and contact with people in a similar situation at a difficult time.
