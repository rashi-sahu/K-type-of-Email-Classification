Introducing RP Fighting BlindnessRetinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited condition of the eye that leads to loss of vision and blindness. RP Fighting Blindness works hard to stimulate and fund cutting edge research to find a treatment or cure and support those affected. You can learn lots more using the links across the top of this page.
Our MissionTo stimulate and support high quality medical research with the aim of increasing scientific understanding of retinitis pigmentosa (and related conditions) and finding treatments for the condition that, when developed, are accessible to anyone affected, and to identify or provide good quality and universally-accessible information and support services for people affected.
Our VisionWe aspire to a world in which people with RP will have access to treatments and will not lose their sight.
Our ValuesThe charity is committed to focus on its objectives, transparency in all matters, collaboration with other organisations, fair business practices and equality of opportunity.
You Can Help UsTake a look at how you can support us by joining, donating, or taking part in an event. You will be helping us give hope to people with RP across the UK and worldwide.
