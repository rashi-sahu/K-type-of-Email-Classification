I
have suffered with epilepsy all of my life [my
story] and still experience seizures every day, despite medication.
To help others understand this condition, I
give talks on living with epilepsy to schools, companies and social organisations
within 100km of my home in Welwyn Garden City, Herts, UK.
I have written articles on epilepsy from the patient's point of view, and have been featured
in national and local magazines. Several radio
and TV stations have run interviews
with me.
Several years ago, I became an
accredited tutor for courses under the NHS Expert
Patients scheme and taught many local people how best to manage their
chronic illnesses.
My
book, Weathering the Storms - living with epilepsy,
was published in 2004. Click on Books above for links to 100s of other books on epilepsy.
For more information and advice
on epilepsy, see my links page. See the latest
news about epilepsy from Google.
Weathering
the Storms has been the in the top ten
best-selling epilepsy books on amazon.co.uk for much of the time since it was published. How to buy it.
It is now also available in Kindle ebook format, instantly downloadable from Amazon in the UK, USA, France and Germany.

"It
is an ideal book for people with epilepsy who want to know how other
people cope with the condition." Review in Epilepsy Action
