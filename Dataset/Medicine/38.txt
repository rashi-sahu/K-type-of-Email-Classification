Albinism Fellowship UK & Ireland
Welcome to the Albinism Fellowship website.
The Fellowship is a positive and sociable volunteer-run organisation that aims to provide information, advice and support for people with albinism and their families. We also provide information about the condition to professionals working with people with albinism, and other appropriate interested parties.
Our focus is on the United Kingdom & Ireland, but we also work closely with other albinism support groups around the world.
For the latest news from the Fellowship and details of upcoming events, please see the News & Events section.
For information about our mission, the services we offer, how to join and how you can support our work, please see the About the Fellowship section.
For general information and articles about albinism, along with personal stories from people with albinism, please see the About Albinism section.
If you have any queries about albinism or the Fellowship, please get in touch.
