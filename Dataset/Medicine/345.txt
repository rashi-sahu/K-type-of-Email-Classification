The Schizophrenia Commission
In November 2011 the independent Schizophrenia Commission was established by Rethink Mental Illness.
One hundred years since Bleuler coined the term, schizophrenia remains a stigmatised and misunderstood mental illness. In November 2011 our expert commission scoped the state of care and outcomes for people living with Schizophrenia in England.
In 2012 the Commission published a groundbreaking report called Schizophrenia - The Abandoned Illness. This revealed a dysfunctional system that is not delivering the quality of treatment people need for recovery and includes key recommendations to promote change.
Rethink Mental Illness’ campaigning priorities have been directly informed by the recommendations of the Commission. Find out what issues we are campaigning on.
