Jane Colby's new book. Free pages & Stripeysocks blog.
Young Hearts is a collection
of inspirational poetry by over 40 children and young people with ME aged
7 to 26. Foreword by Terry Waite CBE. All profits will be used for the
Trust's services. This book was originally the dream of Tymes member Jade
Louise Scarrott who was so tragically taken from us in a road accident
at the age of 14. She wanted to raise awareness and understanding of ME
in children. A review was recently published
by Special Children magazine.
To commemorate Jade Louise Scarrott we present the ITV Central News feature
on childhood ME (broadband version - 11.4MB)
(dialup version - 1.05MB) which
was prompted by the publication of Young Hearts. Includes interviews with
Jade's mother Karen and Jane Colby. If you have problems viewing Windows
Media files, download this version - 2.75MB.
