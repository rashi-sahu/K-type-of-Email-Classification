Evidence is published that supports CPPC campaign for annual check for chronic pain patients
Yesterday marked Opioid Painkiller Addiction Awareness Day (OPAAD) with the CPPC drawing attention to statistics released last year at the launch of OPAAD, which revealed 1 in 6 UK adults were concerned with the amount of opioid painkillers they were taking. New research has now estimated that 2 out 5 people in the UK do not follow national guidelines that suggest adults should restrict the use of over-the-counter opioid painkillers due to risk of addiction. The CPPC has been working closely with a number of Parliamentarians, including Lord Luce and John Cryer MP, to help drive forward awareness raising and campaigning for an annual pain assessment/pain medication review of chronic pain patients in Primary Care.

Opioid Painkiller Addiction Awareness Day
On this day last year new survey data estimated that nearly one in ten survey respondents believed they could be or could have been addicted to opioid painkillers. This research coincided with the launch of Opioid Painkiller Addiction Awareness Day (OPAAD), which aims to raise awareness about the potential for patients to become addicted to painkillers and the consequences of addiction. The CPPC and other organisations are campaigning for every patient on opioid-based pain relief to have, as a minimum, an annual pain assessment / pain medication review of chronic pain patients (in Primary Care or other care setting). For more information, please click below.
