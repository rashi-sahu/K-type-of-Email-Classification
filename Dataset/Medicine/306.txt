Information for women with Pelvic Girdle Pain (PGP) and healthcare professionals
The main aim of our charity is to provide women and healthcare professionals with information about best practice for the treatment and management of pregnancy-related PGP, and to enable and empower women to access the right treatment. We have packed our website with up-to-date information about PGP, so please do have a read, and use and share this resource.
What is PGP?
PGP, formerly known as Symphysis Pubis Dysfunction, is caused by a pelvic joint problem.
PGP affects 1 in 5 pregnant women and symptoms can occur at any stage during or following pregnancy.

Symptoms of PGP
PGP causes pain and stiffness in the pelvic joints, and difficulty walking, climbing stairs and turning in bed.
Pain and dysfunction can persist for months or years without correct treatment.
