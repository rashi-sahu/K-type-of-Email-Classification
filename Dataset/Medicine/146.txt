Fierce Feminine Masterclass
JOIN.MY.TRIBE.
Hey, solopreneur! Still struggling to articulate what your “thing” is, let alone how to tell the world about it (with exactly zero hours in the day)?
Welcome, overwhelmed one. I’m Jo, and I am about to become your new bff.
This is the battle cry for all brave, bootstrapping solopreneurs who :
Can’t look their blog in the eye because they’ve been neglecting it (but can’t find the time, dammit)
Want to go on a creative juice cleanse and rid themselves of all cliches, writer’s block, and buzzwords.
Feel ready to face their tech fears once and for all (and overcome them,  and never look back)
Need a proper dose of support, vision, productivity and a little kick in the pants.
If your ears (or your heart) just perked, there’s only one thing left to do: Join me.
JOIN.MY.TRIBE.
I help people work smarter and in more creative ways. Together, we get your message out to the world via killer content—blogs, copy, images + social.
I am a designer, writer, blogger, mentor, author, creativity addict + prolific geek.
You could call it a portfolio career of multi-potential multi-passions.
I call it being me.
