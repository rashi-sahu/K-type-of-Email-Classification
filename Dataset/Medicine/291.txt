World Book Day and Books on Prescription
Today is #WorldBookDay and with so many fantastic OCD books available we invited our OCD forum and Twitter users to share their OCD book recommendations.
Two of our favourite
OCD book recommendations are 'Break free from OCD' written by three of the leading NHS specialists in the treatment of OCD here in the UK and 'Pulling the Trigger', both compliment CBT well and can be used during and post therapy.
A golden oldie recommendation for #WorldBookDay is the Twentieth Anniversary Edition publication of Brain Lock which was republished recently with new material from the author, a great book that's stood the test of time and is still sold today, 20 years later.
With today being all about the promotion of reading, it's also the perfect time to remind you about the Reading Well Books on Prescription scheme. The Reading Well Books on Prescription scheme objective is to help
you to understand and manage your health and well-being through helpful reading. The scheme is run by the Reading Agency in partnership with the Society of Chief Librarians with funding from Arts Council England and the Wellcome Trust. It is endorsed by health organisations, including NHS England and Public Health England, and delivered through public libraries. The programme has reached 635,000 people in its first three years since it launched in 2013.

Three month wait between therapy
During the last year or so we have plenty of anecdotal evidence
that following a
course of OCD treatment with
an IAPT service (usually just 6-8 sessions), people are
often told they have to wait 3+
months before they can have
further treatment, the usual excuse is that it 'gives the patient opportunity to put into practice what they have learned'.
This is absolutely not the
case, it is not a NICE recommendation and
to ensure we have
factual evidence behind our
advice we confirmed this with
NHS England who told us in
October that:

Weekly or Intensive CBT treatment?
OCD researchers Josie Millar and Paul Salkovskis from the University of Bath need your feedback and help in determining your views on the prospect of undertaking Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) in either the usual 'weekly' format or in a more time 'intensive' format.
They are interested in finding out your views on this and whether both of these treatment formats are viewed as acceptable to people and which one people would prefer if given a choice. This information is important to find out, as it will help them think about how treatment should be delivered and the options that should be available to people who have OCD and are considering seeking treatment.
Both Josie and Paul have always been incredibly supportive of OCD-UK and we would very much welcome your time in taking part in their online research survey.
Participation in this study is completely voluntary, it is up to you to decide if you would like to take part. Even if you decide to participate, you are free to withdraw from the study at any time and without having to give a reason.
For further details and to participate please visit their website at: https://bathpsychology.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_54OLMa98eNx5XpP

Living with me and my OCD
Good luck to Claire Watkinson who premieres her brilliant documentary 'Living with me and my OCD' this Saturday in Sheffield. The documentary was five years in the making, and includes interviews with OCD sufferers from around the world and is well worth watching.
For those not lucky enough to be able to get a ticket for the premiere in Sheffield, there will also be a live feed via her Facebook page at: https://www.facebook.com/LivingWithMeAndMyOcd/
Huge congratulations to Claire and everyone who contributed to her film. The rewards are there to see in the final edit, and everyone should be very proud of their contributions.
