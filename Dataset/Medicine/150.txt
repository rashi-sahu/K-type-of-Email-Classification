Different Strokes represent younger stroke survivors at Sentinel Stroke Audit Meeting.
The results from our recent survey on NHS services which highlighted the areas where services rated poor or variable were presented in NHS Stroke Audit meeting held last Friday. We think there is no better representitive of stroke survivors than a stroke survivor, so we sent Brin, a volunteer and stroke survivor to represent Different Strokes and younger stroke survivors across the UK, using the data from the questionaire so many of you kindly completed for us!
We created the following graphics to support Brin's presentatation. We were keen to express the areas which affect working age and younger survivors and although the figures show mostly where improvement is needed, Brin was sure to point out that many people praise the hard working people within the NHS working at ground level.
