Why Choose Homeopathy?
Homeopathic medicine can be used by people suffering an enormous range of conditions, it is not possible to give a list. Homeopathy deals with the whole person, and that person may have a range of medical problems, sometimes with a doctor's diagnosis, and sometimes not. We do not treat the disease, we treat the person. Go to  What Can Homeopathy Be Used For? for a discussion of this, and some examples from my practice.
You may come to homeopathy because you live a healthy life style, and want your medicines also to be natural and gentle.
You may also choose homeopathy and natural medicines because conventional medicines are not appropriate for you.
You may have a long-term condition, and you feel reluctant to rely solely on drugs for life.
You, or your children, may suffer recurrent infections, and you seek natural medicines in addition to antibiotics.
Perhaps you choose homeopathy because you want a complementary therapy that won’t interfere with your drugs, and can offer more personal support. Homeopathy can be used alongside conventional medication and supplements: for more details, see Taking Medication with Homeopathy.
Above all, homeopathy will help you to work with your own body's healing ability.
Every patient carries her or his own doctor inside.

Homeopathy for Everyone
Homeopathy is suitable for babies, children, pregnant or breastfeeding women, retired people -
– and everyone in between!
Homeopathy has the power to ease many problems, including some that doctors sometimes cannot help. However, do not neglect medical guidance. Homeopathy is complementary to modern medicine, not a substitute.
I offer reliable, unbiased information; I work independently, and I want you, my clients, to be able to make informed choices about your own health.
I also offer Bach Flower Remedy treatment (a lovely safe and easy treatment to balance the emotions, using natural English flower essences in drops) and Buteyko breathing re-training, which can benefit many chronic illnesses, but is particularly well known to asthma sufferers.
