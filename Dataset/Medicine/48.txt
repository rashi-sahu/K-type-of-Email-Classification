.
At AphasiaNow we provide long term help and support for people with Aphasia in the South West of England and nationally through our website and social media.This help includes hosting activities such as support groups, workshops, outings and therapies.
These give our members and their partners support within the community, with the aim to increase confidence and provide an arena to learn new skills.
Support group sessions are chaired by Jenny Dautlich, a retired public health doctor and stroke survivor, and lead by volunteers, people with aphasia, as well as professional therapists.
