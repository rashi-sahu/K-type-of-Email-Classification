At Takeheart we aim to improve the health of our clients and reduce the work load of cardiologists and heart surgeons.

We are a mine of knowledge - it is worth exploring.

Understand your risk for developing Coronary Heart Disease - Heart attack. Takeheart does this for you by measuring a number of clinical variables and feeding the results into an expert system on a PC. We give you a printed report to take home (515). The report covers 7-8 A4 pages and contains the results of the tests, their meaning, calculation of the risk according to the method described by Professor G.Shaper of the Royal Free Hospital in London and advice. (See an example of a report). The tests include history, cholesterol, blood pressure, lung function, liver function, carbon monoxide, weight and stress assessment. You can come to see us in Norwich. We can come to you in the UK. You can take the Check over the internet, reports are constructed and checked by an experienced senior physician so may take a day or two to arrive.

You are offered reassurance, encouraged to take preventive action or asked to consult your own physician, as appropriate to get you off the downhill slope. A "What if?" section in your report quantifies the reduction in your risk possible if you follow the recommended course of action. There is a book list and a "While I'm Here" section.
