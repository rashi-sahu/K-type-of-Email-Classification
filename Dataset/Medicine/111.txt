Sadly, The Cancer Counselling Trust has had to close due to lack of funds and so we can no longer offer you personal support. However, look at our website with its resources and articles and find suggestions of where and how you can find help.
The impact of a cancer diagnosis presents enormous challenges both for patients and those close to them. As well as the need for timely treatment, it is important to recognize that the insecurity aroused by a life threatening condition can result in acute levels of anxiety, anger and self reproach. It isn’t always easy to talk to family members or friends about fears and feelings. For over ten years, The Cancer Counselling Trust provided valuable therapeutic support to over 2000 clients to help them with difficult decisions and emotions as well as publishing useful articles and links to other organizations via this website. Our team of specialist counsellors and psychotherapists all have many years’ experience of working with cancer issues, both face to face and over the phone. Although we had to close our London office and can no longer offer our national free service, the following therapists have private practices. See the Resources section of the contact details.
