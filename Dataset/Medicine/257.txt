Myaware is the name of the Myasthenia Gravis Association. MGA has been around since May 1976. We support people with myasthenia and their families, increase public and medical awareness of the condition and raise funds for research and support staff. Members of myaware can access our free benefits and counselling services.
If you’ve just been diagnosed with myasthenia, you’ve come to the right place. Our aim is to make your life easier. We provide information, advice and support. Call us now or join myaware online. You will have free access to our resource centre which includes advice on everything from the latest medical developments and treatments to how to negotiate the benefits system. You can also get in touch with other members who understand what you are going through.
