International Society for Affective Disorders
The International Society for Affective Disorders (ISAD) exists to promote research into the affective disorders through all relevant scientific disciplines, including genetics, neuroscience and the social and behavioural sciences. Inter-disciplinary research approaches are particularly highly valued by the society.
Although the affective disorders are not a clearly delineated group of illnesses they include unipolar and bipolar depression, generalised anxiety disorder, and more specific anxiety disorders such as agoraphobia, panic disorder and social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). There is a high level of similarity and co-morbidity between these illnesses and it is sensible to consider them as a single group.
ISAD Members are able to post their own peer-reviewed publications and notices on the Society website, find out about the latest research and communicate with other professionals in an online message forum within a secure members area.
Directors of ISAD are President Prof Allan Young, Immediate Past President Prof Sidney Kennedy, Treasurer Prof Antony Cleare and Company Secretary Dr Sagar Parikh with Dr Roger Pinder, Dr Henricus Ruhe, Prof Kathleen Merikangas, Prof Jan Scott, Prof Mohammad Alsuwaidan and Prof Mark Frye.
