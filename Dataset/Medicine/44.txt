What we do
Campaign for change
Every day, we strive to make sure that the people who make the policies know how important it is to make the world a more autism-friendly place. We work hand in hand with young people with autism, their parents and carers and the professionals who support them, because they're the most powerful campaigners we know. Will you join them?
Raise awareness
We know that for society to accept autism as part of everyday life we need to increase awareness and understanding. We also know that evidence of how to support children to achieve the best outcomes is vital. That's why we're committed to working with research partners to spread best practice in autism education.
Run services
We've been providing
specialist education for children with autism since 1997. Founded by a formidable group of parents, the Ofsted 'outstanding' TreeHouse school in North London was the inspiration behind Ambitious about Autism. Now joined by Ambitious College, we provide education and support for children and young people from age 3-25.
