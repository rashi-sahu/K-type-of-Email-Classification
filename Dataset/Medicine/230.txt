Be different… Be happy
As a child, I would have been ecstatic if I had been able to meet others with birthmarks.
My name is Beverley Sky Fulker and I am thankful to have been born with a large facial birthmark (port-wine stain).
It was not always easy but I came to love my mark and now I help others love and accept their marks and scars. My work is not just about birthmarks it’s for anyone who is concerned about their appearance. Children also gain great confidence from my talks and my site.

“Beverley spoke eloquently, articulately, robustly and had a great sense of humour. She was also very comfortable being interviewed ‘live’. We would definitely use her again and I’ve already recommended her to BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour.”
