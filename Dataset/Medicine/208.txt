Announcements
7/December/2016 - The ICGC Data Coordination Center (DCC) is pleased to announce ICGC data portal data release 23 (http://dcc.icgc.org).
ICGC data release 23 in total comprises data from more than 16,000 cancer donors spanning 70 projects and 21 tumour sites.
17/April/2016 - ICGCmed is pleased to announce the release of its white paper (http://icgcmed.org).
The International Cancer Genome Consortium for Medicine (ICGCmed) will link genomics data to clinical information, health and responses to therapies.
18/November/2015 - The International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) PanCancer dataset generated by the PanCancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) study is now available on Amazon Web Services (AWS), giving cancer researchers access to over 2,400 consistently analyzed genomes corresponding to over 1,100 unique ICGC donors (https://icgc.org/icgc-in-the-cloud).
Updates
Currently, the ICGC has received commitments from funding organizations in Asia, Australia, Europe, North America and South America for 88 project teams in 17 jurisdictions to study over 25,000 tumor genomes. Projects that are currently funded are examining tumors affecting: the biliary tract, bladder, blood, bone, brain, breast, cervix, colon, eye, head and neck, kidney, liver, lung, nasopharynx, oral cavity, ovary, pancreas, prostate, rectum, skin, soft tissues, stomach, thyroid and uterus. The genomic analyses of tumors conducted by ICGC members in Australia (ovarian and pancreatic cancer), Brazil (skin cancer), Canada (pancreatic, pediatric brain and prostate cancer), China (bladder, esophageal, gastric, lung and renal cancer), European Union/France (renal cancer), France (liver cancer), Germany (blood, brain and prostate cancer), India (oral cancer), Italy (pancreatic cancer), Japan (liver cancer), Saudi Arabia (thyroid cancer), Singapore (biliary tract cancer), South Korea (blood and lung cancer), Spain (blood cancer), the UK (blood, bone, breast, esophageal, lung, prostate and skin cancer) and the USA (bladder, blood, brain, breast, cervical, colon, gastric, head and neck, liver, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, rectal, renal, skin, thyroid and uterine cancer) are now available through the Data Coordination Center housed on the ICGC website at www.icgc.org.

About ICGC
The International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) has been organized to launch and coordinate a large number of research projects that have the common aim of elucidating comprehensively the genomic changes present in many forms of cancers that contribute to the burden of disease in people throughout the world.
The primary goals of the ICGC are to generate comprehensive catalogues of genomic abnormalities (somatic mutations, abnormal expression of genes, epigenetic modifications) in tumors from 50 different cancer types and/or subtypes which are of clinical and societal importance across the globe and make the data available to the entire research community as rapidly as possible, and with minimal restrictions, to accelerate research into the causes and control of cancer. The ICGC facilitates communication among the members and provides a forum for coordination with the objective of maximizing efficiency among the scientists working to understand, treat, and prevent these diseases.
