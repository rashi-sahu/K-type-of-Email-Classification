My Story
Many of us at the Centre have known that dreadful moment when the consultant looks over his glasses and hits you with the shattering news of your cancer. Whether the treatment involves surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy or a combination of these, the future can hold a lot of worry and stress.
These are some of the journeys of our clients as they move on from a diagnosis.
