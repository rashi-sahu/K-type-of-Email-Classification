Our Mission
Reverse Rett works to speed treatments and a cure for Rett Syndrome and related MECP2 disorders by funding research that will have a practical and positive impact on our children’s lives.
We fund research from basic science to clinical trials and work to facilitate the translation of this work into clinical applications for people with Rett Syndrome and related MECP2 disorders.
