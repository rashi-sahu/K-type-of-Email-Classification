Welcome to The Birth Trauma Association
The Birth Trauma Association (BTA) supports all women who have had a
traumatic birth experience. It is estimated that, in the UK alone, this
may result in 10,000 women a year developing Post Traumatic Stress Disorder
(PTSD).
Also, as many as 200,000 more women may feel traumatised by childbirth
and develop some of the symptoms of PTSD. The BTA wants women to know
that they are not alone. On these pages, we offer emotional and practical
support to women and also their families.
