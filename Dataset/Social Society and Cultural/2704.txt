Welcome
Jamie Andrew is the incredible Scottish mountaineer who, despite having no hands and feet, has made some amazing ascents all over the world.  As a quadruple amputee, Jamie has also made many other remarkable achievements, raising many thousands of pounds for charity along the way.“Hello and welcome to my website.  The idea of this site is to give you an idea of who I am, what I do, and what I’m trying to achieve. It’s my hope that my experiences and achievements may in some way inspire others to tackle the obstacles they face in life and to achieve their full potential.
It seems to me that our greatest limitations are the ones we impose on ourselves.  I want to encourage others to throw out these misconceptions and to be all they can be.”
Remember, nothing is impossible!

Hi Jamie,
I came across your story by chance. So what I want to tell you is, that I was impressed by the serenity you radiate, there is no lie no fake. You paid a high price but you have grown tremendously by what has happened to you. You are a man who overcame death, you have seen death. There are few people who share that.
All the best man, and a hug from Austria

Hi Jamie – I have seen and heard you speak at IMD on the High Performance Leadership over 40 times. Each time I am deeply touched and inspired by you and your story. To watch you inspire so many others as well is an honour. When I had cancer I thought of you through in the really tough moments and it really helped me through.
Your words, ‘I made the decision that this was going to be the lowest point of my life’, resonated through my head when I had, had a no hope diagnosis. They gave me the spark of light I needed to make the same decision and reignite hope in myself and for my family and friends.
Sending all my love and hugs –
Isobel

Thank you for your inspiring presentation today in Brussels. You showed us that even if all seems to go wrong, you can have a dream that tells you what your first step will be.
