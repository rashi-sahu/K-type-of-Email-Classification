This publication is the extended script of an internal monologue, looping thoughts and shuffled fragments combining to form a multi-layered narrative about anxiety as a state of desire.
Rhythms and Disturbances relates to Freyas recent solo exhibition of the same name in the Unit #1 space: an intimate two-channel film installation.
The publication launch will be accompanied by a short performance of new work.
The project Rhythms and Disturbances is supported by the Arts Council of Wales.
