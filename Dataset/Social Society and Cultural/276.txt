Welcome to Aberaeron
On behalf of the
residents of Aberaeron I would like to welcome you to our vibrant harbour town,
perched on the coastline of Cardigan Bay. If this is your first visit, then I
trust you will be immediately impressed by its beautiful Georgian
architecture and its patchwork of brightly coloured houses. If you are a
regular visitor can I extend a warm welcome to you once again.
Aberaeron prides itself
in offering the highest standard of shopping. Our cafes, pubs and restaurants
serve the best local produce available, along with some of the finest real
ales and wines. We have the highest standard of hotels, family run B&Bs
and campsites which will hopefully prove to be a happy, memorable experience.
If you are a keen
cyclist, we have many beautiful cycle routes in the area and our Tourist
Information centre on the Quay will provide you with all the details you need
to make the most of your stay. If you are a walker, then we have beautiful
coastal and inland walks. We have a leisure centre, swimming pool and many
varied sporting facilities such as sea and river fishing, tennis, bowls,
football, rugby, rowing and sailing all readily available for you to enjoy.
The town has an active
community which works extremely hard to organise the the many events and
festivals which are held annually within the town. Full details of these can
be found in this brochure.
I hope that you enjoy
your visit to Aberaeron and that this brochure will enhance the enjoyment of
your stay with us.
