Welcome to the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Animal Welfare, your link to Parliament on animal welfare issues.
The All-Party Parliamentary Group for Animal Welfare (APGAW) is an all-party group made up of MPs, Peers and associate animal welfare organisations or groups with a specific interest in this area. The aim of the Group is to promote and further the cause of animal welfare by all means available to the Parliaments at Westminster and in Europe. APGAW seeks to influence the development and introduction of effective wide-ranging legislation to improve welfare and also acts as a discussion forum of politicians and welfare experts to looks at areas of concern.
All-Party Parliamentary Groups (APPGs) have no formal place in the legislature unlike Select Committees, but are an effective way of bringing together parliamentarians and interested parties to start raising the profile on issues. APGAW chooses topics which are likely to be high profile to discuss and can then put forward ideas for improvements to the current Government. Members of the public are not able to attend APGAW meetings unless specifically invited by the Chairman but they can ask their MP to attend if they are concerned about an area of animal welfare.
