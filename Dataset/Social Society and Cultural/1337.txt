2016 Regatta 28th and 29th May
Posted: May 4, 2016 | Author: topherdawson | Filed under: Scottish Coastal Rowing

Notice of Race:
Ullapool Coastal Rowing Club will be holding our regatta this year at the end of May since the World Championship at Strangford Lough will be held 25th – 30th July, close to our normal time of year.
16 skiffs are so far signed up and we have room for one more, first come first served!
As you come into the village, the wee pier on your left opposite the filling station is the place to launch your skiff. Space there is tight so we would ask people to get their boats off the trailer as quickly as possible and take the trailer to park in the High School grounds. The High School is about 400m away, turn right off the shore road and carry on 300m till you see the signs on your right.
Boats are to be pulled up at the West Shore St beach beyond the big pier, a row of about 400m. Clubs will find marker posts showing where they can make their base at the top of the beach.
There will be a ceilidh in the Village Hall on Saturday night.
Race course
Races will be held over a course of 2km on Saturday 28th and Sunday 29th May, the same course as was used for the World Championship. See the Race Times document.
Start and finish will be from individual marks on a line running out from the beach.  Crews will then race across the loch to their own turning buoy, where they will turn 180 degrees before racing back to the start finish line.  Each boat will be in an unmarked lane between their start mark and their turn mark, and must as far as possible stay in that lane.
Crews approaching their turn must give way to crews coming out of their turn. This is set out in the rules of racing.
Rules of Racing
All racing will be held under the 2013 Edition of the Scottish Coastal Rowing Association which should be viewed at http://scottishcoastalrowing.org/files/2013/03/Rules-of-Racing-2013-Edition.pdf
Starting will be by VHF radio so each cox must carry one. Mains sockets for recharging will be available.
The water around the racing will not be closed to other traffic, and when encountering other craft, crews must abide by the International Rules for Prevention of Collision at Sea.  In particular it should be noted that the Stornoway Ferry is restricted in her ability to manoeuvre when arriving and departing the Ferry Pier, which is beside the regatta race course.  Crews must keep clear of the ferry.
Racing is timed to avoid the ferry sailing times.  It is therefore essential that all races start on time, and it is the responsibility of crews to be ready to take position on the start line prior to the advertised start time. Any alteration to the ferry sailings will be reflected and announced in changed race times.
Camping and caravan pitches can be had near the race course at the Broomfield Holiday Park (which does not accept bookings but has always had camping space) or in a more secluded location 4 miles north of Ullapool at Ardmair Holiday Park, which does accept bookings.
We look forward to seeing new clubs for the first time and old friends once more!

In the bleak midwinter…
Posted: December 21, 2015 | Author: LG Thomson | Filed under: Scottish Coastal Rowing
| Leave a comment
Ullapool is almost as close to the Arctic Circle as it is to London, giving us long summer days, some of them stretching more than 18 hours between sunrise and sunset.  Conversely, winter days are short, a few less than six and a half hours long.  Today, December 21, is the winter solstice – the shortest day of all.
Later this week the sun will rise a little earlier, set a little later, but there’s still a whole chunk of winter to get through before we can look forward to spring and a whole new season of rowing under blue skies and a warming sun.  Ever the optimist…
In the meantime, we can look back on an eventful and enjoyable 2015.

The arrival of the first serious snowfall this winter coincided with the Mixed 40+ training row.  Hardy skiffers or just plain daft?  Either way, it looks like they had fun.  Photographs by Michael MacDonald.
As a reminder of warmer days, also included is a photograph of Lesley and Craig’s wedding from May 2014 – the first UCRC wedding.

Summer cruises into Ullapool

Topher, Tim, Paul, John and Jan had the unusual experience of rowing Cul Mor in sunshine tonight.
The passengers and crew of cruise ship, CSV Albatross, were delighted by their visit to Ullapool, describing it as a beautiful place, full of fresh air and sunshine.

Shieldaig Shenanigans
Posted: August 2, 2015 | Author: LG Thomson | Filed under: Scottish Coastal Rowing

Mike and John in a pre-race cox discussion.
A warm welcome, changeable weather, and a day of mixed results lay in store for the Club at Shieldaig.
With over twenty members of the Club participating in the Regatta we were able to enter two boats in each of the five round-the-island races.  Special mentions must go to Donna who arrived as a supporter but ended up stepping in at at the last minute for the Women’s Mixed Age race, and to our two coxes – John and Mike – who were out for every race.
Tim gets on his race-face while Tom buckles up and Topher strides out before the Men’s Mixed Age race.
Although Coigach won overall, Ullapool’s Mixed 50+ team won the Race of the Day.  Cox, John McIntyre kept a cool head in a fiercely-fought race, during which Coigach’s skiff ran aground.  Lashed by torrential rain, Cul Mor raced to the finish with the Ulla team coming in a very respectable second.  Hats off to the Coigach team for showing great spirit by finishing the course once they had been pulled from the rocks.
The winning Cul Mor team, comprising Kathryn, John, Ian, Lorraine, and John (cox), was awarded a smart silver trophy and a cash prize of £100 which was donated to Club funds.

A plentiful supply of tea, coffee and cake at the village hall kept everyone going, while the much remarked upon bacon and scallop rolls went down a storm.
Clan Chief, Ruaridh MacLennan piping the rowers through the finishing line was a lovely touch.

Ullapool CRC Regatta 2015 – Results
Posted: July 12, 2015 | Author: LG Thomson | Filed under: Scottish Coastal Rowing
| Leave a comment
A big thank you from Ullapool Coastal Rowing Club to everyone who took part in and supported our 2015 Regatta.  You made it a memorable and enjoyable weekend.
The racing was top notch, and with several close finishes excitement levels were sky high. The 50+ Men and 60+ Men categories were particularly tight, with only one second separating first and second place in each race.
There were two seconds in it for the 40+ Mixed and Open Women, and three seconds in the 50+ Mixed and Open Men.
Best time of the day was in the 40+ Men category, with Coigach coming in at 11.49.
In total, eighteen clubs took part.  Coigach won overall with 129 points, Ullapool were second with 111 points, Crail third with 101 points.
More news and photographs of the Regatta will follow, in the meantime full results for all races are listed below.
Before the results, a word from Topher…
Coigach did very well and their junior teams are fantastic. We did well to take the Open Men, 60+ Men (ahem!), and the 50+ Men, and did well in the medals. I’d like to thank all the club members for all their efforts, the Harbour Trust for their generous sponsorship of the marquee, and Robert Hicks for the entertainment.
Cheers, Topher.
