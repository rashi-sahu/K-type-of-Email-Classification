Oral History On The North East Labour History Website
The North East Labour History Society is pleased to announce that it has just published transcripts of the personal memories of sixty people from the North East. You can find these on our website at: http://nelh.net/oral-history/
These oral histories are from people who have spent their lives in the co-operative movement, the mines, other industries, the unions and political activity. We think these transcripts are a valuable permanent record of peoples' recollections of their lifetime experiences.
The material we have here draws on a range of activities undertaken by North East Labour History Society members and others.
Do take a look and tell us what you think. If you have transcripts or notes from interviews with people who have been involved in the labour  movement in the North East we would be delighted to provide space for them on our site (contact@nelh.org). As well as the name of the interviewee and a photograph, it would be helpful to have their dates, where they lived and worked, the name of the interviewer and, if applicable, the project or organisation through which the interview was done. It is important to get permission from the person who has been interviewed to put their information on this site.

Glad to be Gay: The struggle for legal equality
The LSE Library has a spring exhibition which runs from 9 January to 7 April: 'Glad to be Gay: the struggle for legal
equality'. It draws on the unique Hall-Carpenter Archives and the Women’s Library collection to mark the 50th anniversary of a pivotal piece of legislation: the 1967 Sexual Offences Act. Before that, homosexuality was a criminal offence. With the passing of the Sexual Offences Act, homosexuality in private was decriminalised, but genuine parity still was not achieved. The struggle for legal equality continues and has only made progress by the sustained efforts of committed
activists.  See photos from the exhibition here

CfP - Manchester Social Movements conference
SOCIAL MOVEMENTS CONFERENCE  - CALL FOR PAPERS
Dates: Conference 10th-12 April Abstracts by Monday 2oth March Papers by Friday 31stMarch
From 1995 to 2016, Manchester Metropolitan University hosted a series of very successful annual international conferences on 'ALTERNATIVE FUTURES and POPULAR PROTEST'.
We're very happy to announce that the Twenty Second AF&PP Conference will be held between Monday 10th and Wednesday 12th April 2017.
The Conference rubric will remain as in previous years. The aim is to explore the dynamics of popular movements, along with the ideas which animate their activists and supporters and which contribute to shaping their fate.
Reflecting the inherent cross-disciplinary nature of the issues, previous participants (from over 60 countries) have come from such specialisms as sociology, politics, cultural studies, social psychology, economics,  history and geography.  The Manchester conferences have been notable for discovering a fruitful and friendly meeting ground between activism and academia.
CALL FOR PAPERS
We invite offers of papers relevant to the conference themes.  Papers should address such matters as:
* contemporary and historical social movements and popular protests
* social movement theory
* utopias and experiments
* ideologies of collective action
* etc.
To offer a paper, please contact either of the conference convenors with a brief abstract:
EITHER Colin Barker,
email: c.barker@mmu.ac.uk
OR Mike Tyldesley, Politics Section, HPP,
Manchester Metropolitan University
Geoffrey Manton Building, Rosamond Street West
Manchester M15 6LL, England
Tel: M. Tyldesley  0161 247 3460

Marx, Lenin and Anarchism: Revolution in Fitzrovia
Footprints of London - Revolutionary London
London was the destination for communists and anarchists to
meet and argue over the form that the coming revolution would take.
German anarchists had lived in London since 1848 and came to police
attention after assassination attempts on the Tsar of Russia. Lenin knew
London well, and the final split between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks
took place here in November 1903, with tragic consequences for the
Russian Revolution in 1917. The communists had fled police spies in
Brussels to meet in Charlotte St in the guise of an anglers club.
Successive waves of exiles from France, Germany and Russia made
a home in Fitzrovia, close to the British Museum where Marx and Lenin
studied, yet in an area where foreigners ran the bookstores and shops.
On this walk we will find the streets where the leading Communard Louise
Michel lived and established a pioneering Fitrovia school, and revisit
the site of the Autonomie anarchist club, linked by police to the
Greenwich bomb of 1894 which inspired Joseph Conrad’s The Secret Agent.

What they say about the book
‘This collection, containing both texts by participants and retrospective
historical analyses, defends the achievements of the Revolution while honestly
recognizing its limitations, and will stimulate informed discussion.’
Ian Birchall, socialist historian.
‘This is an important collection celebrating the legacy of the Russian
Revolution in its centenary year.  Paul Le Blanc’s Introduction provides
rich historical context for past events.  But the book is really about the
future.‘
Tithi Bhattacharya, Professor of History, Purdue University; editorial
board member, International Socialist Review.
‘A fascinating and unexpected collection of material that shines a needed light
on the workers revolution of 1917. All in all, a spirited defence of the
October revolution at a time when many people would like to forget all about
it.’
Lars Lih, author of Lenin Rediscovered: What is to be Done? in
Context, Haymarket 2008.

Book Review: All My Yesterdays
Walls Come Tumbling Down:
The Music and Politics of Rock
Against Racism, 2 Tone and Red Wedge
Daniel Rachel
Picador, 2016
ISBN 978-1447272687
John
Harris in the Guardian has written a
decent review of Daniel Rachel’s book, which is a sort of cultural history of
the left from the mid-1970s to the 1990s – see
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/28/walls-come-tumbling-down-daniel-rachel-review
I
want to make a few history-related points on the book here. I was indeed there.
I was at the battles of Wood Green and Lewisham, at the Carnivals and on the
streets. I still have a pair of steel toe capped Doc Martens and they weren’t
(mostly) used for industrial purposes. They were, and the book captures this
well, different times.
In
the late 1970s I did not walk down any street without scrutinising those also
walking to see if they might be fascists who were about to attack me. I don’t
do that now because the current strength of organised fascism is low. Indeed I
moved to my current  address in central
Tottenham precisely because it is so difficult to find. Not that difficult
though because the front window still has a bullet hole in it, which I’ve left
as a memoir of different times. I wasn’t in when the bullet was fired, but the
windows are double glazed as a precaution anyway. The times are not so
different though. Racism still needs to be fought, big time in the age of
Farage and Trump. Whether music will be as central remains to be seen perhaps.
Anyway,
the book is essentially an oral history covering Rock Against Racism and the
Anti-Nazi League, Two Tone and Red Wedge. The author has assembled quotes from
a extensive range of people under subject headings in more or less
chronological order.
I’d confess as a professional historian to not being that
enthusiastic about oral history because memory is unreliable and quite
difficult to check. I
wouldn’t bet on every last statement in the
book being accurate but that isn’t really the point. Instead it gives a real
flavour of how culture, music and the left came together to fight fascism,
racism and the right and some idea both of the breadth of the support needed to
do this and the importance of having some coherent political organisation at
its core, whether this was the SWP or the Labour Party or both.
Of
course Red Wedge was not Rock Against Racism and the distinct parts of the book
perhaps don’t have such an automatic follow on. Nor is there an attempt,
understandably it being an oral history, to grapple with what precise longer
term impact something like RAR had.
Since
I was there and know a lot of the people interviewed well the book does read to
me like all my yesterdays. But allowing old socialists to recall the past is
hopefully not what it is meant to be about. It should be read by those who were
NOT there both to get some sense of how movements were built and what is
possible, and hopefully to inspire activity and organisation now.
You
can always criticise and hopefully there is a positive purpose to that but
beyond that this is a book you should read whether you were there and
particularly if you were not.
