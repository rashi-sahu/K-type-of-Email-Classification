British Future research finds Welsh are most excited about Queen’s Jubilee
Posted on 6 February 2012
- No Comments
Ipsos Mori research for British Future has found that the Welsh are more enthusiastic about the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee than the English and the Scottish.
70% of Welshpeople expect the jubilee will lift the mood of the British public compared to 69% of English people asked, and only 55% of people from Scotland.
But, when asked about the Olympics, English respondents were the most positive with 66% believing it would be good for the mood of the British public, compared to 57% of Scots.
The polling also looked at Welsh, Scottish and English opinions on Europe, Britain’s economic prospects and youth unemployment.
David Williamson’s article for Wales Online, The Welsh are the most positive about Queen’s Diamond Jubilee, looks at the results of the research.
