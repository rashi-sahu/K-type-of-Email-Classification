The Children and Technology Lab, headed by Nicola Yuill, is part of the Developmental and Clinical Psychology Group.
NEW! Funded PhD studentship in the Chatlab, on autism and technology!
We are interested in how technology can be used to understand and support children working and playing together, at school and at home, in typical and atypical development, with peers, with parents and with teachers.
An underlying theme of our work is the role of social interaction and collaboration in learning and development. How do interactions between peers support learning? How do parents scaffold children's learning at home? What role does technology play in supporting children's collaborative play and learning? And how might developmentally-appropriate technology be used creatively and innovatively to support these interactions?
Our app ASCmeI.T.  launched, Sussex working with Southampton and Bath Universities

We keep in touch with our Nuffield bursary students, such as Kane Steggles, whose paper on language alignment was accepted for the finals of the National Science and Engineering Competition.
Research from the ChatLab showing how technology engages children’s attention and makes them more co-operative is discussed in a free-to-view Frontiers article and in an edition of Wired.
