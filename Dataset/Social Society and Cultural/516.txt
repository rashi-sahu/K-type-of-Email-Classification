Friends of Llancaiach Fawr
Friends get in FREE
If you join the Friends of Llancaiach Fawr, you'll be entitled to free entry
throughout the year.*  It's a great way to follow the lives of the Prichard
family and their servants through the changing seasons in the turbulent year of
1645.
Friends also enjoy their own events, and a newsletter keeps them in touch
with what's happening at the Manor.
Friends help Llancaiach Fawr in a variety of different ways, and find it
extremely rewarding.  But don't worry if you don't have time to spare.
All we ask of Friends is that they enjoy Llancaiach Fawr and tell everybody what
a wonderful place it is.
*Access is free with a current membership card.  Some charges may apply
for special events.
What are Friends for?
The Friends are people of all ages and backgrounds, united by enthusiasm for
Llancaiach Fawr and its vivid evocation of life in the seventeenth century. Over
the years, we have raised thousands of pounds to enhance the Manor and its
gardens.
We also act as a cost-effective channel through which outside organisations
can support the work of Llancaiach Fawr.
The Friends of Llancaich Wish List
As you may know Llancaiach Fawr has been successful in its
Heritage Lottery Fund bid.  However the HLF grant does not provide money
to, amongst other things, furnish the attics or buy furniture to hide the
radiators.  That's where the Friends come in.  We are raising money to
buy these extra items by selling raffle tickets and receiving donations.
The Wish List allows you to target your donation towards a specific item that is
needed.  Click here to see a copy of the Wish List.
