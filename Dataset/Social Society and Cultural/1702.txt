Gender Violence and Health Centre
A multi-disciplinary research team within the SaME group, the Gender Violence and Health Centre (GVHC) works with partners around the world to conduct action-oriented research to better understand the extent, causes and consequences of interpersonal violence, and to identify how prevention and health-service programmes can reduce violence, in order to improve public health and well-being.
The first systematic study of the global prevalence of violence against women was conducted by GVHC, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the South African Medical Research Council. Released in July 2013, the study found that intimate partner violence affects 30% of women worldwide, or one in three. Current GVHC projects include innovative qualitative and quantitative research on:
trafficking and labour exploitation in the Mekong, South Asia, South America and Central Asia
health-service responses to domestic violence in Europe and Asia
the impacts of community empowerment, economic and social interventions in Tanzania, Uganda, Côte d’Ivoire and on the Ecuador–Colombia border
GVHC runs an annual short course on researching gender-based violence.
