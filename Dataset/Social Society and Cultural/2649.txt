The Grey Panthers
are a small group of walkers from the North East of England. Each week the
walks that the group enjoy are recorded on this site, with photographs to
illustrate the countryside that they have covered. Each walk is accompanied
by a Route Description.
The group walks almost every week in the year, and each walk is about 10
miles long.
