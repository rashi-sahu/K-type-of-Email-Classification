What is Al-Anon?
Al-Anon Family Groups provide support to anyone whose life is, or has been, affected by someone else’s drinking, regardless of whether that person is still drinking or not. For some of our members, the wounds still run deep, even if their loved one may no longer be a part of their lives or have died.
Someone else's drinking can affect your life - be it a relative or friend, male or female.
We believe alcoholism affects the whole family, not just the drinker. We are an international organisation with over 800 support groups in the UK and Republic of Ireland. Al-Anon is a fellowship of relatives and friends of alcoholics who share their experience in order to solve their common problems.
Whatever your relationship to the drinker, whatever your story, Al‑Anon can help.
Al-Anon Family Groups hold regular meetings where members share  their own experience of living with alcoholism. Al-Anon does not offer advice or counselling, but members give each other understanding, strength and hope.

Someone else's uncontrolled and uncontrollable drinking can:

make you doubt your own sanity
make you think that you are the problem
Whatever your relationship to the drinker, whatever your story, Al-Anon can help
