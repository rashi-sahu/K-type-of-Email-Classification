Room for Refugees Refugee Hosting Scheme
www.roomforrefugees.com
With the ongoing refugee crisis, we now have almost 3,500* refugee hosts ready to offer free shelter in their homes. As well as our own casework team , Room for refugees is working in partnership with the British Red Cross, the Refugee Council, and 147 caseworkers from other refugee organisations all over the UK to match potential hosts with refugees who have no recourse to emergency housing, support or funds.
If you are interested and have space to take someone in, whether it’s for a few days, an extended period, or anything in between, please register as a host. It doesn’t matter where you live. Watch out for network meetings in your local area too. You’re not just hosting refugees, your part of  a fast growing movement of people speaking up for refugees fleeing war torn countries trying to gain safe passage to Europe.
We have over 13 years of expertise in safe hosting. Our charity pioneered the UK’s first refugee hosting scheme in 2003 following an increasing number of refugees being made absolutely destitute by the UK government. It has a 100% safety track record, we request full disclosure from hosts, and ensure a risk assessment of each match and safety checks thereafter.
The UK government, in its ‘wisdom’ has rejected any notion of using schemes like ours to resettle Syrian refugees, but ironically we are still sheltering destitute Syrian (and other) refugees.

GOOD NEWS FOR SOME ASYLUM SEEKERS:The Home Office fast track scheme which was ruled illegal by the High court in London is not being appealed by the Home Secretary. All those asylum seekers who were detained under the
Fast Track Scheme and were refused asylum before July 2014 going back to 2005 can now apply to the First Tier Immigration Tribunal to invalidated the old decisons.If you think you are one of the above please ask your Solicitor for advice.*************Asylum appeal fast-track system unlawful, says Court of AppealBy Dominic Casciani Home affairs correspondentHome affairs correspondent Colnbrook Immigration Removal CentreColnbrook is one of the immigration removal centres where asylum seekers are detainedThe Court of Appeal has upheld a ruling declaring a key part of the government's asylum system is unlawful.In June, the High Court said detaining asylum seekers and speeding through their appeals was wrong.That decision has now been backed by senior judges who said the "Detained Fast Track" system did not take into account the complexity of claims.The government said it was disappointed with the outcome and would be seeking further permission to appeal.Ministers have already suspended Detained Fast Track but had told MPs they wanted to re-launch the system within weeks.They will now seek to appeal to the Supreme Court.'Unfair' systemThe decision could have major implications for hundreds of cases where applicants for asylum have lost their case during an accelerated legal process, while being held in detention. Some 323 asylum seekers have been released from detention in the past month, 200 of whom had already had their claims rejected.In Wednesday's ruling, Lord Dyson, the Master of the Rolls, said truncating the time available for appeals was "systemically unfair".The Detained Fast Track system played a key role in immigration removals and could lead to someone leaving the country in about 22 days.The system was created in 2003, and was applied to 4,300 asylum seekers in 2013.Immigration officers could order the detention of any asylum seeker whose case they thought would result in a quick ruling.The system was sometimes used to handle clandestine migrants, such as those entering via the English Channel ports, whom officials thought had no case for refuge.But a string of legal challenges over the past year eroded the power after complaints that many of those being put through the system had suffered torture or had other justified cases for humanitarian protection.'Fairness and justice'Last month, Mr Justice Nicol ruled in the High Court that fast tracking appeals involved "structural unfairness" because claimants could not properly prepare their case, or access expert help, while in detention.And three weeks ago, ahead of a related case, ministers suspended the entire system, telling Parliament they could not be sure that vulnerable applicants were being dealt with fairly.Immigration minister James Brokenshire said the suspension might only last a matter of weeks - but in Wednesday's judgement the Court of Appeal ruled the time limits imposed on the appeals could be "potentially disastrous" if the decision was wrong."The scheme does not adequately take account of the complexity and difficulty of many asylum appeals, the gravity of the issues that are raised by them and the measure of the task that faces legal representatives in taking instructions from their clients who are in detention," said Lord Dyson."It seems to me that some relaxation of the time limits is necessary, but it is not for the court to prescribe what is required to remedy the problem."A lawful scheme must, however, properly take into account the factors to which I have referred whilst, I acknowledge, giving effect to the entirely proper aim of processing asylum appeals as quickly as possible, consistently with fairness and justice."Jerome Phelps, director of Detention Action which brought the original claim, said: 'The Detained Fast Track is a fundamentally flawed process. The courts have repeatedly found that it is structurally unfair towards people who are seeking protection in the UK."Despite repeated changes, it has continued to be unlawfully unfair. Asylum-seekers and the government have a common interest in a system that is both fast and fair. We hope that the government will work with civil society to find a different approach that does not sacrifice fairness on the altar of speed."A government spokesperson said: "We are disappointed with the outcome of this appeal. Notably the judgment recognises the government's aim of processing asylum appeals as quickly as possible. We regard fast track as an important part of our immigration system and the courts do not oppose this principle. We are seeking further permission to appeal."
Asylum appeal fast-track system unlawful, says Court of Appeal - BBC News http://www.bbc.co.uk The UK system to detain and fast track some asylum seekers appealing to stay in the country is illegal, the Court of Appeal rules.

These are the MPs who voted against taking in 3,000 child refugeesThe amendment to the immigration bill was proposed by former refugee Lord Dubs, who himself had escaped the Holocaust as a child. He then went on to become an MP and Labour peer.It would have meant the UK would take in 3,000 children who are already in Europe, having made part of the perilous journey out of Syria.However, the proposal was rejected by 294 votes to 276.These are the MPs who voted to turn away 3,000 unaccompanied child refugeesHigh profile ministers including Michael Gove, education secretary Nicky Morgan, and Boris Johnson were among the many Tories who voted against it.Iain Duncan Smith, the former Work and Pensions secretary who resigned from his post over the government’s disability cuts, also voted against the amendment. So did his replacement Stephen Crabb.Ministers claim they will take in unaccompanied children, but only if they are still in refugee camps near Syria and Iraq.In case you were wondering how your MP or

FREE NAZANIN RATCLIFFEThe UK Prime Minister is not prepared to act to bring this mother and child home, after nine months. Read below an extract of Nazanin's letter to her baby daughter Gabriella (Gisou) smuggled out of the notorious Evin prison, Northern Tehran, through an Iranian human rights group. Can anyone help?"My golden Gisou, forgive me for that first week of our separation, when neither of us knew what was happening, and when you were burning in fever as your way of protesting separation from your mother’s bosom. Forgive me for they took you away not just from your mother, but from your father too. Believe me, I could never imagine you would experience such anguish in a country where your mother came into this world and grew. Had I known, I would never have hurried to pack our suitcase for that two week trip to Tehran last March. That moment of farewell to your father at Gatwick, that cold day of reluctant spring, when you sweetly and naughtily gave him a hug and a kiss on his check, how could I even imagine destiny would strike us separate so long? "My darling, do not sulk at separation. As happiness is not forever, sorrow and separation do not last either. "Never think about passage of time. Only the defeated lament at the cruel plunder of time. We will defeat time, faith and hope are a sword in its stone heart. "My Gisou, there will come a day that we will be together again and tenderly hold one another’s loving hands. If time has deprived us of these days of togetherness and denied your father and me these days of your childhood, we do not fear. They can’t take away from us our memories. They can’t take our dreams for future. "Injustice will not remain unaccountable. It's love that kept us together in these most difficult times, and love will bring us together again."Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, Evin Prison, 24 January 2017
