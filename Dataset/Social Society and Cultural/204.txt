Goldsmiths art students were out in force on the March for the Alternative, in a partnership project with the Museum of London. Students handed out placards with historical protest imagery at the start of the march, and organised collections of placards and props at the rally, hoping to gather a record of creativity in popular protest, to use at the Museum.
The team had loads of placards donated on the day, but are still after more of people’s creative protest art. If you’ve got a placard you’d like to donate, they’ll be holding another collection at the Museum of London on Saturday 2nd April.

And if you’ve lost a pair of Eye Time glasses with metallic blue grey frames, we’ve got them too.
But if you’re a government minister, we’re afraid you can’t have your support back.

Here are some links we like (without necessarily endorsing all the arguments) – and of course there’s lots more good stuff that we won’t have seen.
