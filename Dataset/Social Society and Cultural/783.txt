This Wednesday evening, 1 August, the ‘SOAS Nightmarket’ will be raising money for Lambeth Women’s Project. Come along and swap some clothes, listen to music and eat cake!
Doing your dissertation but you just wanna dance? Bored of all your clothes but don’t want to keep buying new ones? About to move house and don’t know what to do with all those old things lying around?
The JCR is set to turn into a night market of clothes trading, cake selling/eating and music/moves to raise money and awareness about the government cuts to public services – this month we’re focusing on key services for women through the Lambeth Women’s Project (www.savelambethwomensproject.com)
Thank you to all those who participated in the Jumbleshare, if you have any more clothes you’d like to donate do drop them in the collection box in the JCR.
At 6pm on Wednesday 1st August in SOAS JCR there will be djs, food and loads of clothes to come and swap/buy/take all for a small entrance fee of £3 OR £1 plus 3 items!
This will be a chance to have a break from work and spruce up your wardrobe without having to tackle oxford street!!

Armpits 4 August: Discussion event @ LWP
Armpit4August will be running a discussion evening about female body hair and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) at LWP, on Thursday 19th July from 7-9pm. All self-identified women welcome.
The organisers from Armpits4August will be giving a short presentation about their campaign and their recent day of action in central London. Armpits4August are asking women to grow out their armpit hair this August to raise money for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) charities.
As the campaign aims not only to raise awareness of PCOS but also to create a safe space to discuss women’s complicated, emotional, or embarrassing experiences of body hair, the presentation will be followed by splitting up into small groups for a consciousness-raising (CR) session where these issues can be examined supportively. We will end by coming back together as a group to review the impact of the CR session and how this relates to the role(s) of women in society. Armpits4August is an event for all self-identified women and we hope to host a lively evening of discussion and debate which reflects feminism’s many intersections.
