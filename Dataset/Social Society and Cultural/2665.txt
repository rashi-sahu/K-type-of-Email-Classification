with easy access to the A38, Plymouth, Dartmoor, Bodmin Moor and both the north and south coasts of Cornwall.
Many National Trust properties and the Eden Project are within easy reach by car, and there are facilities for both golf and
coarse fishing in the area. If you are visiting the area for a wedding or family party there is easy access to Plymouth,
Saltash, Liskeard, Tavistock and Callington. Hay Lake Farm is also a convenient stop-over for relatives attending passing out parades at HMS Raleigh,
those working on their boat at Boating World in Landrake or attending Landrake Motocross meetings.
Equestrian facilities
We can also offer you the opportunity to bring your horse on holiday with you as we have equestrian facilities available.
The area around us has an abundance of quiet lanes that are ideal for hacking out. Please contact us if this is of interest to you so that we can provide further information.

changing scenery of hedgerows and wildlife throughout the year.
