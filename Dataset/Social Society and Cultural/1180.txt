Have your say
DOZENS of iconic images which have made the Queen one of the world’s most recognisable faces have been brought together in Belfast for a stunning new exhibition.
The collection, including works by some of the most famous artists of the 20th century, has been carefully pieced together showing Her Majesty as a mother and much-loved family member, as well as a head of state and peerless ambassador for the Commonwealth.However, many of the 60 photographs, oil paintings and even an incredible hologram image are controversial.
Among the artworks are the Andy Warhol originals of his widely copied classics and the almost cartoon-like Lucian Freud depiction of the Queen — a priceless modern classic which continues to divide the art world a decade after it was commissioned.
Many of the works will be on show in Northern Ireland for the first time when the exhibition — The Queen: Art and Image — opens at the Ulster
Museum tomorrow.Art lovers are particularly excited at the prospect of standing inches from the Warhol and Cecil Beaton originals, but the unconventional work by Freud is already proving a real attention-grabber.Due to the distinctly unflattering nature of the relatively tiny 9”x 6” image, many have been shocked that the painting was commissioned by the Queen and then retained in her private collection.Admiring the 2001 oil painting at a press preview this week was local art enthusiast and media figure Eamonn Mallie. “You could not put a value on this painting. Freud is one of the biggest figures in the art world,” he said.
Other highlights are an illuminated hologram compiled from 10,000 facial shots taken by artist Chris Levine, and a 40sq ft montage of the Queen made from over 1,500 images of Princess Diana. Kim Mawhinney, head of art at National Museums NI, said she wanted the public to come along and enjoy the variety of work on display.“This is fundamentally an art exhibition on portraiture and the change in portraiture over those years. Because of the Queen’s long reign she is the perfect subject for making such a comparison,” Ms Mawhinney said. Running until January 2012, the collaboration between National Museums NI and the National Portrait Gallery is one leg of an exhibition tour, also taking in Edinburgh, Cardiff and London, to coincide with the Queen’s diamond jubilee next year.n The Ulster Museum is open Tuesday to Sunday from 10am – 5pm and closed on Mondays (except for Bank Holidays).
