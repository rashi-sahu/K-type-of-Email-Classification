Lee Valley Regional Park Authority
Lee Valley Regional Park Authority runs award winning open spaces and sports venues along the 26 mile long, 10,000 acre park. The park was created by a unique Act of Parliament as a “green lung” for London, Essex and Hertfordshire. Our approach is to be community focused and commercially driven, to work with partners to produce a unique combination of activities, sights and experiences.
