Members
Ibex Mountain & Hillwalking Club is a hiking, mountaineering and trekking club based in London.
New members are always welcome.
Weekend Trips
Weekends are organised by club members. We stay in bunkhouses,
mountaineering huts, hostels and campsites.
Leaving London on a Friday afternoon, usually sharing cars or travel by public transport.
Members plan several hike routes based around a longer day on Saturday and shorter day on Sunday.
We'll eat together on Saturday evening, with everyone helping with meal preparation.
Day Walks
Day walks are open to all members and prospective members.
Routes are planned within the South East and start from a railway station, a short journey from London.
They're a good way to build your fitness before coming on an Ibex weekend
for the first time.
If you would like to come along, please just turn up on the day, there is no need to contact the organiser in
advance.
Monthly Club Night
We meet on the second Tuesday evening of each month in central London.
There is usually an hiking-themed
slideshow or workshop and it's a good opportunity to meet other club members for a drink.
New members are always welcome.
Come along to the next club night
on Tue, 14th Mar 2017.
