Latest news from ioLight portable microscope
After weeks of anticipation now is the time. You can now
purchase shares in ioLight by going to our Crowdcube pitch
at

2016 was an exciting year for ioLight. Riding on the success of
our 2015 Crowdcube campaign we closed our first sales just 5 months
later in April. Even this was later than we planned, because we took
the decision to redesign the prototype to make it more robust. However,
the redesign has paid off and feedback from early customers is good,
with some impressive pictures on our website.

Another Facebook update from Steve "B"
"Romsey's 15th Boxing Day Pre 1976 Car &
Bike Meet charity update - Hi folks, just to let you know that monies
have continued to roll in from my very generous customers, thank you
all very much.
JustGiving donations have also continued &
thanks to all who have donated there recently. The good news is that
we are way up on last year, not only have we smashed the 4k mark for
the 1st time ever but we've smashed the 4.5k mark & the total currently
stands at £4,717.91 !! 2 weeks left until I close it down on the 31st
Jan, so still time to give if you enjoyed the show but missed the 30
collection tins you can donate at
justgiving.com/fundraising/MRB-STEVE-BIDDLECOMBE#
My polite letter to the owners of Cafe Nero &
Costa were given in last Monday ( after emails to headquarters drew
no joy ) but still NOTHING, not a reply nor a donation, from the 2 businesses
that probably benefit most from the event itself on the day. After 4
years of trying, they still won't donate even the smallest amount as
a nod to the event & the business it brings them. I'm a little fed
up of local businesses making so much from my hard work but well chuffed
that the good & generous have helped us reach this great total,
thank you all.
Thanks for your time.

Hoddinott Close in Abbotswood wrongly
named
It
seems that the newly built Hoddinott Close on the Abbotswood
estate has been wrongly named by one and all. The Post Office,
Test Valley Council and Google maps all spell it with one "d".
Even the road sign is wrongly spelt, see left.
Hoddinott Close was named after
Ernest Edward Hoddinott of Moorcourt Farm Romsey who was
a Councillor on Romsey Extra Parish Council from its establishment
in 1895 until 1949 (a period of 55 years).

US Army in Lockerley 1944
Lockerley was the site of a huge storehouse
for the US Army prior to the Invasion of Europe, established
in October 1943 and largely obsolete by October 1944 by
which time supplies were being sent direct to France. The
depot was behind St Johns Church off of East Tytherley Rd
and comprised 15 miles of sidings and 134 covered sheds.
After the US army left and a period of use by the Royal
Army Ordnance Corps it closed in the 1950s and now nothing
but slight earth disturbance remains.

About Romsey UK
Romsey is a small market town in the county
of Hampshire, England. It is 8 miles (13 km) northwest of Southampton
and 11 miles (18 km) southwest of Winchester, neighbouring the village
of North Baddesley. Just under 15,000 people live in Romsey, which has
an area of about 4.93 square kilometers. Romsey lies on the River Test,
which is famous for fly fishing, predominantly trout. It is one of the
principal towns in the Test Valley Borough. A large Norman abbey dominates
the centre of the town. Romsey was home of the 20th-century soldier
and statesman Lord Mountbatten of Burma, the 19th-century British prime
minister Lord Palmerston, and the 17th-century philosopher and economist
William Petty. Romsey is twinned with Paimpol in Brittany, France, and
Battenberg, Germany.
Romsey HistoryMiddle Ages to the Civil
War
The name Romsey is believed to have originated
from the term Rūm's Eg, meaning "Rum's area surrounded by
marsh". Rum is probably an abbreviated form of a personal name,
like Rumwald (glorious leader).
What was to become Romsey Abbey was founded
in 907. Nuns, led by Elflaeda daughter of Edward the Elder, son of Alfred
the Great, founded a community — at his direction — in what was then
a small village. Later, King Edgar refounded the nunnery, about 960,
as a Benedictine house under the rule of St. Ethelflaeda whose devotional
acts included chanting psalms while standing naked in the cold water
of the River Test.The village swelled alongside the religious community.
The Vikings ran-sacked Romsey in 993, burning down the church. But the
village recovered, and the abbey was rebuilt in stone in about 1000.
The religious community flourished as a seat of learning, especially
for the children of the nobility. A market was established outside the
abbey gates.The Normans built the large current abbey that dominates
the town (between c. 1120 and 1140) on the site of the original Saxon
church. By 1240, 100 nuns lived in the convent.
King Henry I granted Romsey its first charter.
This allowed a market to be held every Sunday, and a four-day annual
fair in May. In the 13th century, Henry III permitted an additional
fair in October.
The lucrative woollen industry appears to have
powered Romsey's growth during the Middle Ages. Wool was woven and then
fulled or pounded with wooden hammers whilst being washed. It was dyed,
and then exported from nearby Southampton.
Romsey continued to grow and prosper until plague
struck the town in 1348-9. The Black Death is thought to have killed
up to half of the Romsey's population of 1000. The number of nuns fell
as low as 19. Prosperity never returned to the abbey. It was finally
suppressed by Henry VIII during the Dissolution of the Monasteries in
1539. Many religious buildings were destroyed during this time.But
the abbey was saved from demolition because part of it was a parish
church for the people of Romsey. The town purchased the abbey from the
Crown for £100 in 1544. Ironically, the part of the abbey that had saved
the abbey, the church of St Lawrence, was then demolished.
By the mid-16th century Romsey's population
was about 1,500; its woollen and tanning industries fuelled growth.
On 6 April 1607 King James I granted the town a charter making it a
borough. This gave official status to an informal local government that
had been running the affairs of the town since the Dissolution of Romsey
Abbey in 1539. Romsey could now have a corporation comprising a mayor,
six aldermen and twelve chief burgesses, with a town clerk for 'office
work'. Furthermore, there was to be a local law court under a Court
Recorder, assisted by two sergeants-at-mace. Over all, was the prestigious
position of High Steward, the first of whom was the Earl of Southampton.
(Lord Brabourne, grandson of Lord Mountbatten of Burma, is the current
High Steward.)
Romsey changed hands several times during the
English Civil War. Both Royalist and Parliamentary or Roundhead troops
occupied and plundered the town. Royalists remained in control of the
borough until January 1645.
18th to 20th centuries
The town's woollen industry survived until the
middle of the 18th century, but was beaten by competition from the north
of England. However, new fast-growing enterprises soon filled the gap
with brewing, papermaking and sack making, all reliant upon the abundant
waters of the Test.By 1794 a canal connected Romsey to Redbridge
— at the mouth of the River Test — and Andover to the north but within
50 years had largely fallen into disuse. Industry continued to grow.
Romsey was a reasonably large town for the early 19th century: its population
was 4,274 in the first census of 1801, compared with just 8,000 for
Southampton.
Despite the arrival of the railway in 1847 the
expansion slowed and whilst its population had grown to 5,654 in 1851
it then stagnated and by the time of the census half a century later
(1901) the population was just 5,597.
Lord Palmerston, the 19th-century British
Prime Minister, was born and lived at Broadlands, a large country estate
on the outskirts of the town. His statue stands in the Market Place
outside the Town Hall.
The Willis Fleming family of North Stoneham
Park were major landowners at Romsey from the 17th until early 20th
centuries, and were lords of the manors of Romsey Infra and Romsey Extra.
Romsey was famous for making collapsible boats
during the 19th and early 20th centuries, invented by the Rev. Edward
Lyon Berthon in 1851. The Berthon Boatyard in Romsey made the boats
from 1870 until 1917. They were used as lifeboats on ocean-going liners.
Broadlands later became the home of Lord Mountbatten
of Burma, known locally as "Lord Louis". He was buried in
Romsey Abbey after being killed in an IRA bomb explosion in Ireland
on 27 August 1979. In 1947, Mountbatten was given his earldom and the
lesser title "Baron Romsey, of Romsey in the County of Southampton".
After Lord Mountbatten of Burma died, his titles passed to his elder
daughter, Lady Brabourne, who thus became Lady Mountbatten of Burma.
Her eldest son was styled by the courtesy title "Lord Romsey"
until he inherited the title of Lord Brabourne in 2005.
The Prince and Princess of Wales spent the first
night of their honeymoon at Broadlands.Embley Park, a country estate
located on the outskirts of Romsey was the home of Florence Nightingale,
most famous for her pioneering work as a nurse and sanitary reform during
the Crimean war and for laying the foundation of modern nursing. Florence
is said to have had her calling from God whilst being sat under a giant
cedar tree in the grounds of Embley Park on 7 February 1837. The site
is now home to a private school, reminders of Florence's formative years
are all around the house and estate.Nightingale is buried in the
family vault at St. Margaret Church in East Wellow, located on the outskirts
of Romsey. Her coffin was taken by train from London to Romsey Station
where a horse drawn carriage completed the journey to the church for
a simple funeral at the request of Florence.
During 2007 Romsey celebrated the 400th Anniversary
of the granting of its Charter by King James I with a programme
of events from March through September, including a visit on 8 June
from the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. Subsequently. the cost of
the visit has created some local political controversy
Present
Romsey today appears to be in sound economic
health. Whilst there is significant commuting out of the town for work
- particularly to Southampton and Winchester, and also, to some extent,
London - it could not be described as a dormitory town.Whilst heavy
industry in the town has long since declined, three industrial and trading
estates focus mainly on service industries and small-scale manufacturing.
Three major scientific and high technology employers — Roke Manor Research,
Southampton Science Park and IBM — have large establishments in the
nearby countryside.The recently renovated town centre contains a
Waitrose, and Aldi supermarkets, a small department store, and over
100 other retail outlets of various kinds, including both high street
chains and local independent shops.There is concern about the decline
of local independent shops due to the high business rates, and threat
from large supermarkets.
Sadler's Mill
Watermills have played an important part in
Romsey's history as an industrial town. The Doomsday Book of 1086 provides
the earliest record of watermills in Romsey, which identifies three
(possibly four) mills.Sadler's Mill is probably the best known of
Romsey's surviving mills and is apparently the only mill to be developed
on the main course of the River Test. The existence of Sadler's Mill
is first recorded in the 16th century, when it was owned by the manor
of Great and Little Spursholt. Functioning as a corn and grist mill,
it has passed through a succession of owners including Lord Palmerston
who rebuilt it in 1747 and sold it in 1777 to one Benjamin Dawkins.
Following another succession of owners it returned to the Broadlands
estate in 1889. Milling ceased in 1932, when the mill building became
redundant. The Broadlands estate sold the building in 2003, at which
point it was close to collapse having been derelict for many years.
The new owners, Anthony and Sarah de Sigley, restored the building in
2005, rebuilding much of the original structure. During the restoration
evidence of an earlier structure was found; carbon 14 dating established
the age of this to be circa 1650.Governance
Romsey has its own parliamentary constituency.
Its current MP is Caroline Nokes of the Conservative Party. Elected
in the general election on 6 May 2010, she ousted the Liberal Democrat
MP Sandra Gidley with a 4.5% swing to Conservative from Liberal Democrat
and a majority of 4,156 votes. Gidley had held the seat since a by-election
in 2000.Notable buildings
Romsey Abbey
Romsey Abbey is a Norman abbey, originally built
as a Benedictine foundation, housing a community of Benedictine nuns.
The abbey is open daily to visitors as well as being the Anglican Parish
church of Romsey.
King John's House
King John's House & Tudor Cottage was allegedly
a hunting lodge used by King John of England whilst hunting in the New
Forest. However, the existing building dates from much later. It does
contain a number of extremely unusual and exciting historical features,
including medieval wall decorations and graffiti, as well as a floor
made of animal bones.
