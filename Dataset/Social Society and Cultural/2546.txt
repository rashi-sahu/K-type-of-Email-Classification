Welcome to East End walks
Tours through radical times and places
East End Walks specialises in organising walks of London’s radical social history, especially in the East End – an area in which successive waves of immigrants have helped make London what it is today. These walks bring to life the people and places of the area especially from the 1880s, when Jews arrived in large numbers from Eastern Europe, to the 1930s when they united with non-Jewish East Enders to drive out Oswald Mosley’s British Union of Fascists at the Battle of Cable Street.
Additional walks highlight the people and movements beyond the East End who played such an important part in campaigning for radical change north and south of the River Thames
“Your walk was interesting, instructive, moving and funny! Every lover of London and every lover of freedom should take it.” Prof. Carlotta Fontana – Milan, Italy
