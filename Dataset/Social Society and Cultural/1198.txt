Welcome To The Castle and Gardens of Mey
Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother first
saw what was then Barrogill Castle in 1952, while mourning the death of her husband, King George VI.
Falling for its isolated charm and hearing it was to be abandoned, she decided to save it.
Having acquired the most northerly inhabited castle on the British mainland, The Queen Mother renovated and restored
it and created the beautiful gardens you see today. For almost half a century she spent many happy summers here and
shorter visits at other times of the year.
The Castle and Gardens of Mey have held Visit Scotland's highest award of a 5 Star quality assurance grading every year since their first unannounced visit in
2007. Their annual assessments include all aspects of the castle, gardens, animal centre, gift shop and tearoom. This is a great accolade for the castle and visitor centre, and well-earned
recognition for all the hard work and enthusiasm of the staff.
We hope that you too will enjoy your visit to The Castle and Gardens of Mey, including the visitor centre and animal
centre.
