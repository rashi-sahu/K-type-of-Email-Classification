A high-level overview of the Budget, including infographics and a regional map.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer with the Budget Box
The government’s plan for the economy, first set out in June Budget 2010, is based on:
fiscal responsibility to deal with our debts with a credible deficit-reduction plan
monetary activism to support demand and keep interest rates low
supply-side reform to help businesses create jobs and deliver lasting prosperity
This Budget will help those who aspire to work hard and get on, buy a home, start a business or save for retirement.
The economy and public finances
The ongoing impact of the financial crisis, the euro area crisis and the effect of inflation on incomes and business costs, have produced a more subdued and uneven recovery than expected. In response, this Budget announces:
increasing capital spending plans by £3 billion a year from 2015 to 2016, funded through reductions in current spending
a reduction in departmental spending of £1.1 billion in 2013 to 2014 and £1.2 billion in 2014 to 2015, the schools and health budgets remain unchanged
public sector pay awards will be limited to an average of up to 1% in 2015-16
Growth
This Budget sets out further action to build a stronger economy, with help for UK businesses to create jobs - and help for people to buy their own home, including:
making the UK tax system the most competitive in the G20 by reducing the main rate of corporation tax to 20% – the joint lowest level in the G20
giving businesses and charities entitlement to a £2,000 per year employment allowance towards their employer National Insurance Contribution (NICs) bill, from April 2014, to reduce the cost of hiring staff

Fairness
This Budget includes measures to build a fairer society by making the tax and welfare system fairer, by supporting aspiration and by keeping costs down for households and business, including:
meeting the commitment to make the first £10,000 of people’s income free from income tax a year ahead of schedule – the personal allowance will be increased by £560 to £10,000 in 2014 to 2015; by April 2014, 2.7 million individuals low-income people under 65 will have been lifted out of income tax altogether
cancelling the fuel duty increase that was planned for 1 September 2013 to support motorists and businesses – fuel duty will have been frozen for nearly 3 and a half years, with pump prices 13p per litre lower from April 2013 than under previously announced plans
