Welcome to St Mary’s Church Saffron Walden
St Mary’s is home to a vibrant Christian community in the historic market town of Saffron Walden.  Belonging to the Church of England, we are people of all ages and outlooks whose mission is sharing God’s love.  Services range from cathedral to café style and our strong musical tradition includes an excellent robed choir.  The church is open daily for worship and to welcome visitors to a place where the Christian faith has been celebrated for over 800 years.
Our church is open every day of the year from around 8.30 am until dusk or later.
Something for EveryoneWe gather for worship on Sundays and during the week, but there are many other activities going on at St Mary’s, for all ages.  As well as choirs and music groups there are Brownies, book groups, bell ringing and more besides. Find out more about the different groups you can join here.
Our Buildings ProjectTo make our church more welcoming to visitors and worshippers. We’ve already upgraded the heating in the main church space and are now working on the later phases in our £500,000 buildings and heating project. Find out more about this project and how you can help.
Opportunities for PrayerAt St Mary’s Church there are many opportunities for prayer, whether as part of our varied services for worship or in the different prayer groups on offer. We also have a number of Saturday workshops focusing on prayer which can be found in our Calendar , Grapevine and News pages.
