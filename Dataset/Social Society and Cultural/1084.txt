ABOUT US
Situated in the mountain village of Pontrhydygroes in the very heart of rural Mid-Wales, Merlin Cheeses is owned and run by Gill Pateman and her family.   Merlin Cheeses was established when Gill’s eldest daughter developed an allergy to cow’s milk. A Toggenburg goat called Sara joined the family in the early 80’s, providing milk for the family along with many progeny – Sonia, Stella and Sian amongst many generations since. With plenty of milk to process Merlin Cheeses was born and started being distributed nationally in 1986. In the last twenty or so years Merlin Cheeses has progressed from producing cheddar cheeses from goats milk to producing cheddar cheeses from cows  milk.
