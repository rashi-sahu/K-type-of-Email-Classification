The Parish Chest
Home Page
For centuries the precious
documents of the parish were stored in a locked
chest in the church for their safe keeping.
The St-Keverne Local History Society is hoping to
place on this web site as many of the numerous
documents, photographs, illustrations and recordings
relating to the history of the parish of St-Keverne
on the Lizard Peninsula Cornwall, as it possibly can.
We hope to cater for everyone interested in the
parish history and the site will be useful to those
tracing their family history as well as those with a
more general interest.
The majority of the statutory documents such as
baptism, marriage and burial listings have been in
the care of the Cornwall County Record Office since
the early 1960's as have many other records of
interest to family historians such as census returns,
protestation returns and hearth tax listings. But we
feel that all of these are of such fundamental
interest that we must include them.
We hold the archive produced by
Canon
Diggens who was vicar in St Keverne at the
end of the 19th century. He researched into
every aspect of our history available to him at
the time in both national and local archives.
One example, from the State records, of information
sent in 1640 to King
Charles 1st from Algiers stating that
"here are about 5,000 of your subjects in
miserable captivity...."
Over the centuries we have a number of records of
fishermen being snatched from their boats of the
coast of the parish by "Algerines" and
"Flemings" and many of the 5,000
unfortunates mentioned above would have been Cornish
and from this parish.
He also consulted "the oldest inhabitants"
and wrote down their memories on subjects as varied
as how the post office were persuaded to deliver mail
to the parish to where buildings have been
demolished.
The archive can be viewed by clicking on the
Canon
Diggens links.

Podcasts
The Shipwreck of The SS Mohegan on the Manacles in
1898 and the terrible loss of life of 106 passengers
and crew, is told in tape recordings
made in October 1966, and is now available as a
podcast, along with talks by some of our guest
speakers.
You can read about the making of the Mohegan Tapes by
clicking here.
The tapes record interviews with three St. Keverne
people who had either witnessed the tragedy or who
had heard first hand accounts of it within their
families.
You may download the St Keverne Parish records,
family genealogies, some of the Mohegan tapes, and
other recordings from the downloads page, to view or
listen to at your leisure.
How you can help
If you have origins in the parish we would like to
hear from you and if you have written the history of
your family we would like to include it in the
archive.
The parish has a history that can be traced back for
thousands of years and it has been studied by
numerous historians, both amateur and professional,
for several centuries. Ideas change and opinions vary
so if you are researching a particular subject we
suggest that you consult as many sources as you can
and make your own mind.
