Club House Extension - Mick George
Clubhouse Extension Project
Your New Committee
Please support our second team as they face Ely 1 in the coutny cup semi-final on Thursday.  8.00pm ko at Ely.
Club House Extension - Mick George Community Fund
Our clubhouse extension project has just been given a major boost with a £50,000 grant award from the Mick George Community Fund.
Please see the full press release here.
Steve Bowller says “Fundraising is well advanced towards the overall required target. The Mick George monies will hopefully be the catalyst for our Members and Supporters to make the final push to get us over the line”.  Details on how to make a contribution are included in Steve's original letter to members.
Clubhouse Extension Project
Having already secured planning permission and funding of £420,000 we are now appealing to members, friends and supporters to raise the remaining £80,000 to get us over the goal line so that we can start this much needed changing room project.
For details of what this would mean to the future of your club and how to make a donation please see Steve Bowller's letter.
As you can see we are already on our way, many thanks to those who have contributed already.  Can we get the team over half way before the end of this year?
At the AGM this week 3 new members were voted onto the committee.  Please welcome:
Gary Barr
Deborah Barr
Shaun Grady
Gary will take on the role of Secretary. Deborah is our Membership Secretaray and Shaun has been involved in the changing project.
Steve Bowller was also confirmed as our new President replacing Alan who remains on the committee.
We'd finally like to thank Adrian Carpenter, who has stepped down as Secretary after 7 years of service the club, Jimmy Dore who will step down from his Finance role, and Jonathan Woods for his contributions to commercial this year.
We are now looking for a Finance Director to replace Jimmy so please get in touch if you are interested.  Or indeed if you can contribute to our club in any other way - we always need more volunteers.
You can see the full committee here.
