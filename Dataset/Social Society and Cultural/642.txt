Workhouse History Centre
Welcome
Llanfyllin Workhouse is a developing community centre and venue for the arts, music, creativity and education, with a strong commitment to green hub principles. The Workhouse is owned, managed and supported by the Llanfyllin Dolydd Building Preservation Trust (registered charity no.1091097).
Built in 1837, this imposing stone building served as a workhouse for up to 250 inmates until 1930, when it became a local authority institution and later a care home. It finally closed in 1983.
The Workhouse enjoyed a brief period of rejuvenation as an outdoor pursuits centre, before being left empty from the mid 80’s. The historic yet rather austere buildings remained empty and derelict until local residents formed a charitable body to save the buildings. eventually taking full ownership in 2008. Work began soon after, clearing the site and preparing to renovate led by local volunteers as well as visitors from afar.
The buildings and surrounding land is now owned and run by the community, for the community.
The aim is to strive to be a leading force in the integration of education, arts, entertainment and employment using a holistic and sustainable approach based upon sound social and environmental principles. The Workhouse is developing as an exciting hub for education, music, local produce, green crafts and arts.
Permaculture study group at the Workhouse in 2009
We want to attract people locally, across Wales, from the UK and beyond in creative events, courses and gatherings. We aim to provide valuable learning experiences for all ages and will have a broad spectrum of educational and training courses including green crafts, gardening, creative arts and performance skills. Besides generating its own activities,
The Workhouse makes available space and facilities for community organisations and for creative enterprises. We are encouraging local initiatives and contributing to rural regeneration.
Refurbishment of the building is in progress, with much of the work carried out by volunteers using recycled materials wherever possible.  A Conservation Management Plan has been drawn up, and all work is designed to accord with established conservation principles and with the building’s listed status.
The Workhouse History Group is carrying out research into the history of the building and of the Llanfyllin Poor Law Union.  It has collaborated with The National Archives to catalogue the extensive, untapped collection of material held at Kew and has digitised the minutes of the Llanfyllin guardians in Powys Archives. Historical exhibitions have been held and it is planned to develop further educational resources and ultimately a Workhouse History Centre.
Restoration of the front range roof in 2011
The restoration of this historic building presents a huge challenge and we cannot do it without the help of our supporters. We are looking for volunteers to help us with many aspects of the development and there are a number of ways to get involved.
