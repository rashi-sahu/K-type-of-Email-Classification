Where to see the seals
Norfolk is a great place to enjoy outdoor activities
There are plenty of reasons to visit at any time of the year. There's plenty of things to do in the Norfolk Broads such as boating and sailing, canoeing and kayaking; go crabbing or rockpooling at the coast and enjoy the attractions of Great Yarmouth, Cromer and Hunstanton; and Norwich is a hot bed of events, activities and entertainment.
We don't agree with Noel Coward's Private Lives 'Very flat, Norfolk' comment, but it's true we don't have many mountains. Gently undulating would be more like it, which makes cycling and walking through beautiful countryside and along unspoilt coast an absolute joy.
Wondering what to do in Norfolk? We have fabulous golf courses (although it can get a bit Crazy in Great Yarmouth), including links, and if you can't have a break without a twitch, we have some of the best birdwatching in the UK.

Festivals & Culture
There are so many things to see in Norfolk
Art lovers and culture vultures will be in their element. You'll find many galleries and exhibitions, and concerts range from classical at country houses to outdoor pop in Thetford Forest. Festivals include beer, literature, food and drink and the biggest of them all - the Norfolk and Norwich Festival in May.
Whatever the weather, Norfolk has attractions to suit all tastes and pockets, from adventure parks to animals in zoos, from historic houses to excellent gardens and museums.
Norfolk is also a county where history comes to life â€“ and what a history it is, ranging from Seahenge, which has been dated to around 2050BC, to the award-winning Time & Tide museum which tells the story of the Great Yarmouth fishing industry.
Those who have left their mark on Norfolk include Romans, Saxons, Normans, Dutch and Americans. Figures from history include Boudicca and Nelson, whose national importance is such that their statues top-and-tail Whitehall in London, and the Hollywood actor James Stewart earned honours as a courageous second world war air force commander flying from a base in Norfolk.
Norfolk County Council's Out and About in Norfolk has information including Public Rights of Way, Windmills and activities for children and young people.
