Jail Guitar Doors - rehabilitating prisoners through music
Jail Guitar Doors is an independent initiative which aims to provide
instruments to those who are using music as a means of achieving the rehabilitation of prison inmates. Founded by Billy Bragg, it takes its name from the b-side of the Clash’s 1978 single ‘Clash City Rockers’. Billy writes:
"In early 2007,
I was looking to do something positive to mark the fifth anniversary of the
death of Joe Strummer when I received a request from a local jail. Malcolm
Dudley, a drug and alcohol counsellor at nearby Guys Marsh prison in Dorset, was
utilising his skills as a musician to set up a guitar class as a means of
engaging prisoners in the process of rehabilitation. Borrowing a guitar from the
prison chaplain and repairing an old nylon-strung instrument found in a prison
cupboard, Malcolm began to make progress with the inmates. However, he soon
became aware that their development was being held back by the lack of available
instruments on which to practise between sessions. He wrote to me asking for
help.
I immediately grasped the potential of Malcolm’s work, knowing from
my own experience how playing guitar and writing songs can help an individual to
process problems in a non-confrontational way. I bought half a dozen acoustic
guitars and, just as Joe Strummer had painted slogans on his guitar, had them
spray-painted with the titles of Clash songs – ‘Clash City Rocker’, ‘Stay Free’
and, of course, ‘Jail Guitar Doors’.
Having delivered the guitars and
heard from the inmates themselves about the positive effects of the work that
Malcolm was doing, I wondered if there might be other people like Malcolm in
prisons across the country, willing and able to do the work, but held back by a
lack of instruments. At the NME Awards in March 2007, I announced the formation
of Jail Guitar Doors to find such people and meet that need. I am pleased to say
that the first person in the room to walk up to me with an offer of support was
Clash guitarist Mick Jones.
Since then, Jail Guitar Doors has
donated instruments to more than 20 prisons. Sponsorship from Gibson Musical
Instruments has allowed us to extend our reach beyond the UK.
The average cost per prison is less
than £500, an amount which could be raised at a benefit concert by any band or
artist that can draw a crowd. I’m asking musicians, particularly those of you
who were inspired by the Clash, to raise funds to help inmates take the first
steps towards rehabilitation. If you’d like to participate in this initiative,
please contact me here.
Stay free."
