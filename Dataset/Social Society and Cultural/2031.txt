STEM Team East is an education charity of over 27 years standing.  Our aim is to promote the successes of a STEM education to school pupils; provide teacher Continuing Professional Development (CPD) through developing links with STEM employers; enhance and enrich the delivery of a STEM education and enable progression pathways into STEM careers.
Our key method of engaging with schools is through the national STEM Ambassador scheme and we work with STEM Learning Ltd  to achieve this.  STEM Ambassadors are STEM professionals who volunteer their time and expertise to support STEM enhancement and enrichment activities.
We work directly with all schools in Cambridgeshire, Peterborough and Bedfordshire and, through the national schemes we manage, we work with other schools in East Anglia.
We provide bespoke consultation on STEM enrichment to each secondary school; teacher CPD in digital electronics and CAD; teacher and pupil STEM workshops and large scale STEM Fairs (both local and regional) with hands–on practical learning activities, career events and talks. We manage national programmes such the British Science Association CREST Awards.  We work with the key stakeholders in STEM Education.
