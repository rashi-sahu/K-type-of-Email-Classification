Advice To Chefs - Substance Over Form
Fancy presentation of food may satisfy a chef's ego. However, if the presentation makes it difficult to eat the food then it won't satisfy the diner's appetite.
Substance over form please chefs!

The Olive Grove Brighton
Eva and I went to the recently opened Olive Grove (15-18 Meeting House Lane, Brighton, BN1 1HB) last night and were very impressed.
It serves a variety of Mediterranean food, ranging from tapas plate portions to full main courses.
I started with the Charcuteria, a very generous portion of Mediterranean cold meats served with traditional bread. I then had the veal chop, served with potatoes and spinach. My compliments to the chef; the chop was tender, succulent and tasty.
Eva started with the Souvlaki a skewered combination of chorizo, chicken, beef & seasonal vegetables. Very tasty, and very generous (two skewers!). She then had Keftidakia & Mash (homemade meatballs served with tomato sauce & mash), which were flavoursome and hearty.
The ambiance was great, and the restaurant pleasantly busy.
The staff were welcoming, friendly, efficient and cheerful.
The bill, including wine, coffee and liqueurs (plus a free Grappa) came to around £65.
We really enjoyed our meal, and will definitely go there again.

Hellman's Mayonnaise
Hellman's have recently begun marketing a new product called "Hellman's With Olive Oil".
I was rather puzzled as to why they emphasised the olive oil, given that standard mayonnaise recipes use olive oil as one of the key ingredients.
Therefore, I looked at the ingredients of Hellman's other mayonnaise product "Hellman's Real Mayonnaise".
It seems that their "real" mayonnaise doesn't contain olive oil, but in fact contains soybean oil.
How can this be called "real" if it doesn't contain olive oil, and why do they not call their new product "real" given that it now contains olive oil?
Sadly they can't, because it isn't "real" either; as it contains soybean oil as well as olive oil.
Therefore the question remains, how can Hellman's call their original product "real" mayonnaise when it doesn't contain any olive oil?

Saint Jamie's Sugar Rush
Saint Jamie of Oliver was on TV last night proselytising against the evils of sugar.
All very well and fine, given that some people consume bucket loads of the stuff and have clearly damaged their health.
However, in a free country, we are all entitled to go to the devil in our own way.
Notwithstanding that, Saint Jamie intends to put a sugar tax on sugary drinks in his restaurants. In theory the extra monies raised will be used for good works against the "evil" sugar.
That aside I draw your attention to Saint Jamie's recipes:
‘chocolate love cake’ contains 21 teaspoons of sugar
sticky toffee pudding 12 teaspoons
tasty sundae 16 teaspoons
gluten-free Christmas cake every slice has 28 teaspoons
salmon dish has three teaspoons of sugar, as does his chicken garden soup.
Jamie’s milkshakes, which contain more sugar than a can of Coke
Oh, and while we are at it, take a look at the salt content in his branded sauces!
Hypocritical or what?
