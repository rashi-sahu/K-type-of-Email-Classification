Can we
demonstrate that war is obsolete?
Is war successful in achieving its objectives?
Can war be controlled or contained?
What are the costs of war?
What are the
causes of war?
Can the world move forward to another
way?
Friends, the project is now with you!
In 2000, Westmorland General Meeting of the
Religious Society of Friends
(Quakers) in Britain, began a peace initiative,
called Preparing for Peace, to explore these questions with international
experts and witnesses. Read the texts of our papers (9),
public lecture
series (19) and supplementary papers (4)  and find out more about our initiative (by Rachel Rogers),
publications and education
programme.
In November 2003 the lecture series was completed.  The education and speaking programme continued until Spring 2008 when the programme was laid down as had been planned. During that time two of the
project leaders
had prepared general papers which they used as a basis for each of their presentations see Brian's Walker's paper (pdf file) and Daphne Sanders paper (pdf file).
We have done what we planned to do and we give you all these resources to to help you take the path of Preparing for Peace forward.
In Friendship and with love, the project team.
