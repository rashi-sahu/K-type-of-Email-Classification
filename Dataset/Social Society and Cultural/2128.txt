Welcome to Trans Media Watch. We are a charity dedicated to improving
media coverage of trans and intersex issues.
Trans Media Watch helps people in the media to understand these issues and
produce clear, accurate, respectful material. It also helps trans and intersex
people who are interacting with the media to get results they are comfortable
with.
Our vision at Trans Media Watch is a Britain in which the portrayal of trans
people and their lives in the media is fair, respectful and accurate. We want to
see an end to the prejudice, bigotry and hate routinely directed at trans people
and we want the media to play its role - no longer fuelling these things. We are
more than happy to work with any representative of any media organisation to
help them do a good job.
To find out what Trans Media Watch could do for you, please take a look at the
