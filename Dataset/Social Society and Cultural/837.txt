Welcome to the Chepstow Society website!
We are a local society, formed in 1948, to explore and promote the remarkable history of the town, and to keep an eye on developments in the town.
The Society has published many books and pamphlets, and was instrumental in placing the pavement and wall plaques around the town.
We meet every month in the Drill Hall in Chepstow, to hear a talk of local interest, and to hear about developments in the town, and we also organise tours and excursions for members.
Please look through this website to see what is in store  maybe well meet you in the Drill Hall?
This is our formal Mission Statement:
Objects of the Society (Mission Statement)
