The People's Millions
2014 Finalists
Past winners
The People’s Millions was a partnership between Big Lottery Fund and ITV, where the public helped decide which local community projects got up to £50,000 of National Lottery funding.
2014 was the last year of The People’s Millions, and there will be no more rounds in the future.
Thanks to all the groups that took part over the years and everyone who voted.
See if there’s a project near you that won.
Since 2005 The People’s Millions has funded 599 projects – that’s over £31 million of funding for local communities.
