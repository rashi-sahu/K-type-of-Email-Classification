Testimonials
"I was fortunate enough to be put in contact with Judy when my mother was first diagnosed with Vascular Dementia.
She made a real bond with my mother, who is a very private person, but made her feel that she was still an important member of the family and valued.
Judy is a very giving person and was very thoughtful and caring towards my mother, I feel that she dealt with any situation in a very sensible and positive manner.
I never felt the slightest qualm in leaving them together all day knowing that my mother was much more positive and happy by the end of a session with her.
I would not hesitate to recommend Judy in any caring environment.
Her positive and sensitive attitude and general good sense always shine through."
