Welcome to the Dandie Dinmont Terrier Club
The Dandie Dinmont Terrier Club was founded in 1875, making it the world's second oldest dog breed club. Our dogs have an even longer history. Their pedigrees can be traced back to the 1830s, and the breed goes back to the early 1700s - yet the dogs have changed very little in the last 150 years.

The Dandie Dinmont Terrier took its name from a character in a novel written by Sir Walter Scott in 1814, but the dogs were around long before that. Known as Mustard and Pepper Terriers, describing their two colour varieties, they were highly prized as working terriers in the Scottish borders, where they were sent to ground after rabbits, rats, foxes, otters and badgers among others. They were often owned by gypsies and poachers - and in fact all the Dandies around today are descended from a poacher's dog found in a trap on the Duke of Buccleuch's estate - in 1839!
In the modern age, the Dandie Dinmont is rarely used as a working terrier, but still makes an exceptional companion dog. They are hardy, intelligent, friendly, gentle with children and a good watchdog. They are not too excitable - like some breeds of terrier - but they have very much a mind of their own.
As Sir Walter Scott himself wrote: "The race of Pepper and Mustard are in the highest estimation at the present day, not only for vermin killing, but for intelligence and fidelity. Those who, like the author, possess a brace of them, consider them as very desirable companions."
