At Bay View Farm
Camping Site we offer you a warm welcome to our Cornish coastal farm,
with
its wonderful sea views overlooking Looe and St George's Island.
The camp site is right on the South West Coast Path, making it
an ideal holiday location for exploring the cliff paths to Black Rock beach, Millendreath and the quaint fishing village of Looe
with its
hideaway streets, harbour, fish quay, beach and cafés offering delicious cream teas. Further along the coast path is the village of Polperro, with its wide choice of restaurants and taverns, smugglers' cottages and harbour. In the other direction the path leads past the Monkey Sanctuary towards the villages of Seaton and Downderry
During your stay, get acquainted with our magnificent prize-winning Shire horses - they are a real pleasure to see.
Bay View Farm has pitches for tents and motorhomes, and full washing and laundry facilities. We also have two luxury static caravans with en suite showers and gas central heating. Free WiFi. We do not take touring caravans - see Important Notice below.
At the 2010 Royal Cornwall Show, our Shire Horses were awarded 'Best Decorated Harness' and 'Best Agricultural Turnout'. More pictures in our gallery
Bay View Farm is listed in 'Cool Camping', 'Great Sea View Camping and Caravan Sites in Britain', the Telegraph '25 Top British Campsites', the Sunday Telegraph 'Britain's 20 Best Coastal Campsites', and the Independent 'The 50 Best Camp Sites'
