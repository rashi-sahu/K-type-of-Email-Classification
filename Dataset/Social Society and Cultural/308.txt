BEMIS Scotland in collaboration with the Scottish Government are delighted to announce the commencement of a new programme which invites multicultural communities across Scotland to join the celebration of the 2016 Year of Innovation, Architecture and Design and the 2016/17 Winter Festivals.
The new programme, which is being supported by a £54,000 funding contribution from the Scottish Government, builds on the success of earlier similar activity led by BEMIS Scotland in 2014 and 2015 and esteems to practically enable Scotland’s ethnic and cultural minority communities to participate in and enhance the dynamic celebrations which are taking place across Scotland.

Skills Development Scotland (SDS) and BEMIS have joined forces in a bid to raise visibility and awareness of Modern Apprenticeships (MAs) within the ethnic and cultural minority communities, and increase their participation in the programme.
MAs provide the chance to ‘earn and learn’ in a wide range of jobs and sectors and give the Modern Apprentice a chance to develop skills, experience and gain qualifications.
A Modern Apprentice is:
For a young person aged between 16 – 24 years
A real job gaining you a wage from day one
Open to entry, technical and professional learning on-the-job
Working towards an industry-recognised qualification
To get started or to learn more about the programme, visit the project page.
Note: this project has now finished.
Gathered Together - Cruinn Còmhla, was a project between BEMIS and SPTC to support parents from ethnic and cultural minorities getting involved with their children's school, which finished in March 2016.
Funded through the Scottish Government Early Intervention Fund and managed by The Big Fund, this new innovative approach is to encourage parents and carers from ethnic and cultural minorities throughout Scotland to come and be part of Parent Councils enabling wider parental participation in their children's education.
