It was all excellent! We loved the taxi transfers to and from the airport - well you can't beat an S class Merc can you? Especially when you want to pop up to the Splendido on the way to the airport to have a look around.... Absolutely superb.  Thank you. James Ellis.

Hi Rosa, firstly we would like to say a massive thank you to you for arranging such a brilliant holiday for us. Everyone had said how nice Rome and the surrounding area are but you never know until you see it for yourself and I am pleased to say that we weren’t disappointed.
Rome: Transfer was a bit late but the chap was very nice and got us to the hotel with little fuss. As you had said the hotel is in an excellent location and we had a nice large room with a nice little terrace. The private tour around the Vatican was amazing. No problems picking the car up at the train station but getting out of Rome was a little stressful!!
Casperia: Again as you had said an amazing location and lovely B+B. Maureen and Roberto were very welcoming and helped us with any questions. The wine and olive oil tasting was excellent.
Sperlonga: The hotel was very clean and comfortable but the room was not very big, meaning the suitcases could not be stowed away so they were in the way. The food at the hotel was excellent but as we were out of season the shuttle bus from the hotel was not running so we had to walk to the town, and there are lots of steps so not for the faint hearted! The plus point at being out of season is that the hotel, beach and town were extremely quiet so it was nice to be able to relax and not have crowds of people everywhere. The hotel did not have its own section of beach with beds, but did offer a discount to one of the ‘sun lounger areas’ for 12 Euros a day.
Fiumicino: We dropped the car off at the airport with little problems once we had found the correct car park (whacky races springs to mind). We then got in a taxi outside the terminal and asked for Fiumicino and got some very puzzled looks from the driver. He then set off in the direction of the town and stopped twice for directions!! On the last time of asking he offloaded us and a local showed us to the hotel and the driver had the cheek to ask us for a tip for having 2 suitcases!!!!!! The hotel Seccy is very nice and I would certainly recommend it for anyone who needs a stopover near the airport, very large rooms and lovely breakfast.
All in all we had an excellent trip. I don’t think we will be heading back to Italy next year as we have been 2 years in a row now but when we do return we will definitely consider using Italian Connection again.
Thanks again. Paul O'Connell

Rosa, Finally, a long over-due email!
Everything about our trip was perfect. I will just jot down our feelings in bullet points- *the taxi company sent great drivers, all on time *the villa was absolutely lovely. such a quiet spot, so close to town, we could not have been happier. We cooked at home a few nights, but otherwise, were out and about in Positano. The owner, Luciana, was so lovely, and she didn't demand any deposit from us on arrival, which was nice. *Restaurants we loved: Palazzo Murat, exceptional meal. Il Fornillo, very good pizza. Bruno, excellent pasta, nice setting outside. *Beach, we went to the one to the right of the main one, the one you recommended and it was quiet and much more relaxing, and had lots of delicious sandwiches from the beach bars *We got our food at Delicatessen, where the owners were really nice *Spent the day in Pompeii, which was amazing. No problem getting there and back on the buses and train, and we even had a very good meal in Sorrento, right next to the station, which I found recommended in Lonely Planet, of all things. One of our wedding gifts was an amazing guide at Pompeii, a professor named Dr. Federico Poole. We spent 4.5 hrs with him which seemed like it passed in 5 minutes. I would not have missed that day for anything. and it really was not hard to get to from Positano at all. We did not miss having a car, so thank you for that recommendation. The buses were quite an experience. *Did the Walk of the Gods, which we also really enjoyed, though we went from Positano to Praiano, and it was hard getting home. I think doing the other way is better, which is what most people do. *Transferred to the Monastero, but via the bus and the hotel shuttle. The taxi was €90, so we decided to spend that on dinner at the hotel, which was AMAZING. *Everything at the hotel was amazing. they upgraded us to a suite, the service was excellent, the room quiet and lovely. I would say that the rooms were a bit cold in atmosphere, but everything about the hotel was so luxurious, and the pool and gardens so well tended, that I should not complain at all. The pool was one of the best that I have ever experienced. *we rented the scooter, and it was very easy so thank you for that *we rode up to Ravello for the day and had a great lunch at Cumpa Cosimo, which we found one of our favorite meals *One evening we ate at the hotel, which I think was the best meal we had the whole trip, and having blown our budget on that, we ate the next night at one of the seafood/pizza places you recommended in the village, which was excellent. I'm afraid I don't remember the name at this point, but it was on your list and you said they would take care of us, and they certainly did.
I think most of all is that I would say this is a must do trip from London. We got there so fast, that we could really enjoy ourselves from the start. It was also the BEST time of year to go, as it was 28 degrees every day, but not too hot, and not at all too crowded. I'm sure it would be different in July.
All in all, thank you so much for all your recommendations and bookings. We had a fabulous trip and I will absolutely recommend your trips to everyone I know!  All the best, Morgan

Hi Rosa
Sorry for the late e-mail! I know I said I’d send you one sooner; I’ve just had a bit of a manic couple of weeks since getting back!!
well where to start: - The apartment was great its position is about 500 metres from St. Peters square which was lovely especially if you want to be near the Vatican. If getting around is a bit of an issue then this location is not for you. As a rough idea to walk to the colosseum it is about a 40 minute walk. However if you want to see St Peter's Basilica without the queues get there for between 7 and 7.30 you can walk straight in and see it in all its beauty.
The first night we walked to Campo di Fiori which was about 15 minutes walk and ate at 'Mercato' it was a nice little restaurant overlooking the square and the food wasn't too bad. Just be prepared for someone to play an instrument very badly and then try and get some money off you!! it seems to happen at just about every place!
The second day we walked to the colosseum and got a group tour around it! Be aware that when you pay for a group tour they may just show you around a few bits and tell you things which you probably could have worked out yourself! Our guide kept slating the English and then kept referring to a puffin children’s book all about gladiators which was English and bought in England! (double standards!lol) from there we went over to the Palatine hill which was great but be prepared for lots of walking up and down slopes and steps! we then went on to Trevi fountain and had lunch just around the corner at Baccano which is quite a grand restaurant although the food wasn't great everything was laced in salt (I think it was a ploy to make you buy more drinks!) we then went on to the pantheon and then onto Piazza Navona where there is a great gelateria which had the best ice cream we found in Rome! (it was about half way up one of the sides with a couple of steps leading into the room). That night we ate in a local resturant which was terrible I didn't think you could go that wrong with pasta!!!
The third day we did the early morning private vatican tour which you arranged for us and which was, wait for it! AMAZING we had a great guide who knew so much about the place, really brought it to life and was able to explain everything! from there we went up to Piazza del Popolo for lunch which was average, nothing terribly special (can't remember the name of the cafe) that night we went out to campo de fiori again but this time went to Da Pancrazio which is where Julius Caesar was murdered the food wasn't great but the theatre downstairs was quite interesting, being able to see this roman ruin now being used as a dinning room!
Our final full day in Rome we went on a general walk about we stopped for lunch next door to Trajans market. There is a small cafe overlooking the site, be aware don't eat there! The food is terrible and the staff are useless. When we got up to leave the head waiter just pushed past me without saying anything! Trajans market is definately worth going to. The entrance is a bit out of the way. You have to go up a flight of steps and then round to the right, but once there it is stunning. make sure you go out onto the roof as you get a great view of the open market and across to the vittoriano after that we went over to the capitol museum which was great but its quite hard to find your way around! That night we went to the Trevi fountain to see it all lit up and then back to Piazza Navona and went for dinner at Dolce Vita which was the best place that we ate at in Rome! The waiter was great and really friendly and the food was lovely (quite pricey tho) a starter, main and a bottle of wine came to 90 euros but it was a great way to finish our time in Rome!
The following day we took a train to Naples (which was delayed by an hour but they kept putting the time back in 10 minute intervals so you couldn't go anywhere or do anything to pass the time!). We arrived in Naples which was a bit of a shock as there was rubbish everywhere and everything was covered in graffiti. Once we got to the Hotel Decumani we relaxed as it was lovely. The staff were great and more than happy to point you in the right direction or order you a taxi! The first night we ate in a little cafe near to the hotel which was ok but nothing special.
1st full day we went to get a train (circuvesuviano) to Pompeii but they were on strike so we ended up waiting for 1 1/2 hours for a train to take us there! when we arrived we had just over an hour to go around the site as we wanted to go up mount Vesuvius as well (there are great views from the summit although the 500 metre trek to the summit is quite tiring! I found it quite easy but I like climbing and I'm quite active anyway but there were a lot of older people who found it quite hard! if you are less able get a tour in the morning so you are not pressed for time that way you can do it at your own pace make sure the weather is clear as I’m not sure how much you will be able to see on a cloudy day!). That night we went to Sorbillo as it was supposed to be amazing, unfortunately no one told us that there are two Sorbillos within about 5 doors. We went to Antonio e Gigi Sorbillo. The food was good and the prices are so cheap two people each having a pizza and a couple of beers came to about 20 euros.
The following day we decided not to take the train as they were on strike again so we decided to take a taxi to Herculaneum which you can do on a fixed price in this case you got collected from the hotel taken to the entrance for the site, the taxi then waits around for you for 2 hours and then collects you and takes you back to the hotel. It is more expensive at 70 euros but it saves wasting a lot of time if the trains aren't working! We then went to the other Sorbillo (Gino Sorbillo) which is the 'home of the pizza' and they were amazing! Two pizzas and a couple of 7 up for 15 euros which was great!
That night we got a taxi down to the Marina and had dinner at La Scialuppa. the food was incredible if you like sea food then you'll love this place! We had steak and it was one of the best steaks I've ever had! The atmosphere was lovely and it was a great way to finish of our couple of days in Naples!
The Negatives
Rome: Watch out for beggars as they are everywhere and prey on tourists!  The food in Rome on the whole wasn't all that great so don't think that because you are in Italy you are going to have amazing food! Everyone thinks there a great cook, but in reality there are few in Rome!
Naples: There is rubbish everywhere! Be careful where you walk as quite often there is poo on the floor! As for graffiti its everywhere! There was even some at the summit of Vesuvius! It is such a shame as the city could be lovely.  Watch out for 'baby gypsies (pick pockets) we didn't have any problems but everyone warns you about them!
If you are not a good passenger in a car you won't like the taxi rides as they fly up these little alleys only inches away from the walls! ……………but these are me being picky and honest, just makes you aware of things before you get there!
Apart from that it was a great holiday and we had an amazing time! Rosa you are a star. Everything ran smoothly! I just wish you'd managed to get the pope to come and say hello! After all we'd made the effort to go and see him! But you can't have it all!
Thank you again. Love Charlie
p.s. I hope this detail makes up for the late response but i wanted to write it all down for you!!

Hi, we enjoyed our trip to Amalfi. Positano was great. Lots of steps! Furore was more problematic. B + B was great. Food fantastic but buses inconsistent making travel very difficult. Weather hot scenery wonderful. Transport on time + courteous. Will keep in contact for future holidays. Andy
