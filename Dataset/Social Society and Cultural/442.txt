Welcome
Cymdeithas Aberaeron Society is a community heritage charity set up following the award-winning heritage project for the Aberaeron Bicentenary celebrations. We work to celebrate, interpret, and present the maritime, architectural and social history and heritage of Aberaeron and the surrounding district.
What do we do?
We organise a diverse programme of activities, including a series of talks, social events, trips, and the Aberaeron Exhibition. We have collected over 4,000 photographs, hold a wealth of written material and have a growing library of digital and web-based resources, presenting Aberaeron life yesterday and today in sound and vision.
We Aim To…
Involve the whole community
Encourage people to volunteer, learn new skills and participate
Work with other organisations
Find a permanent home for our heritage collections
