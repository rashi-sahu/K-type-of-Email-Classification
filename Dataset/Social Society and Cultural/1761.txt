While I was walking my dog at the weekend, a middle-aged man decided to tell me “nice tits”, look me up and down, and purposefully walk as close to me as possible.

‘These were the clothes I was wearing when I was harrassed whilst on my way to work one day. I was passing an Ann Summers store with some very provocative black bondage type underwear in the window, and a man was outside it accosting women who went by, shouting loudly and laughing, indicating how fun it would be to see each one in the aforementioned undergarments. It was not pleasant – he followed me for a while shouting until (I presume) he spotted another victim.’

About...
Inspired by the women's dirty laundry project in India and the Clothesline Project in the USA, we have started an 'I Did Not Ask For It' UK campaign. We are asking women across the country to send in, or take a photo of, a garment of clothing you were wearing when you were sexually harassed or assaulted and with "I did not ask for it" painted or pinned across the garment...continued in 'about' section.
