The Ostle Family History Net - Welcome
Welcome!
The Ostles are an old Quaker farming family originating from the area
around Silloth and Abbeytown in North Cumbria, England. Today Ostles are living in all
parts of the United Kingdom, and in Germany, Canada, the U.S.A. and Australia. We are very
pleased to meet you.

Our Name. . .
. . . has been spelt Ostell, Ostel and Ostle. According to the Oxford
Dictionary of Surnames, it probably derives from the same root as
hostel, hotel and hospital and may mean someone who offers hospitality. However, a tradition in
some branches of the family suggests there may be a link to the small town of Osteel in Lower Saxony,
now part of Germany but formally in The Netherlands.
Our Homelands. . .
. . . lie in the extreme north-west corner of England in the old county of Cumberland, now
part of Cumbria, not far from the Scottish border.

Our Story. . .
. . . begins in the time of King Henry VIII
and continues through the 17th and 18th centuries when the family became Quakers and were
severely presecuted for their beliefs. By Victorian times the family had spread far and wide --
while many farmed the land, others' jobs ranged from railway navvy to railway director!
