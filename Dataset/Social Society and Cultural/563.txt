Heddon on the Wall Local History Societyis an organisation within the historic village of Heddon on the Wall for people interested in the history of the village and the wider area of Northumberland, Tyne & Wear and Durham.The Society is a member of the Association of Northumberland Local History Societies. We hold meetings once a month, usually taking the form of an illustrated talk by a local speaker, and also have occasional outings to places of interest outside the village. You are most welcome to join us or just come to any of the talks that interest you, usually for only a small charge.Much of the information on this site is based on the memories and research of local people. I must  in particular, thank Pat Farnaby, a previous resident of Heddon, who had assembled historical information about the village for his previous village web site. This I have extensively reused here, with his permission. I have also used the historical information on the village collated by the late George Clark of Station Road, Heddon (died November 7th 1966 aged 63 years), previously serialised in 'Vision', the newsletter of St Andrew's Church. Without their prior efforts, my job would have been considerably harder. Many others have provided the photos and memories reproduced here. Please respect their copyright.

To quote from the Northumberland Village Book (Northumberland Federation of Women's Institutes 1994):
Among
the new, however, still lurks the old - the carter's cottages,
the
joiner's/undertaker's cottages (with the stables behind), the
first
church house with the hearse house next door, the depot where
coal was
stored before being taken downriver to Newcastle and beyond.
The village
is now an amalgam of old and new, but totally homogeneous
in
character.
It is people that make a village community, and
despite
the
changes of
bricks and mortar, the character of the
village has not
changed.
I gradually came to see the history of the village through photography of the present for the Geograph project. I make no apologies for making extensive use of those photos here. One thing that becomes clear is that history starts today. There is a need to record and document more recent changes too, that will soon seem as strange to new generations as those that took place 100 and more years before.
