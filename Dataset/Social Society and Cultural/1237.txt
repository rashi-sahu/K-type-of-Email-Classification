The Wombourne Games
Posted on July 16, 2012

A summary of this weekends Wombourne Games, written by Dave Meageen, Organiser:
Friday and Saturday saw the Wombourne Games take place.  The event attracted hundreds of people and over 500 people took part in the games which was a fantastic success.  Participants age range from age 1 -90.  Medal winners from age 3-72 – our table tennis final was contested by two gentleman over 70 years old.
The Wombourne Games covered traditional sports such as athletics, football and swimming.  We have organised table tennis, netball, pool, fishing, bowling, patchwork quilting, the great Wombourne Bake off, flower arranging, cake decorating, computer games and many other sports and activities. We also showcased other activities such as martial arts, fitness, dance and the Arts – we had have our fantastic Wombournes Got talent competition which took place throughout the entire day on the event stage  – as well as entertainment from Wombournes own ‘Different Class’  and Sam and Ryan who presented on stage and sang their own set of family songs.
Got to Dance (Sky One)  finalists ‘Antics’ were literally mobbed at the end by enthusiastic fans following their breathtaking performance. To complete the fantastic family day the rock choir Fusion which had around 100 members singing sang songs such as Viva La Vida and We are the Champions with the audience singing and taking part! The night finished with a fantastic firework display.
Perhaps the impact created can best be summed up by a few quotes from the participators from the day…..
‘ I thought I was past it! This has given me a new lease of life’
‘I won, it was my daughter who entered me into the event. Wouldn’t have done it myself’.
‘what a fantastic way of bringing everyone together!’
‘So much talent, where do I start?’  judge WGT
However, as one spectator summed it up…….
‘So many people, so many smiles, a community that has a real sense of pride’.
What a great community event! It was wonderful to see so many young people inspired to take part alongside all members of the community. There certainly was ‘something for everyone’. A great success ….
Wombourne, a place where we share our success, try our best and aim to be ‘the best we can be’.
Thanks to everyone who took part, attended and contributed to the Wombourne Games.  It was a truly memorable event for all the people of Wombourne – we hope you have many happy memories!
