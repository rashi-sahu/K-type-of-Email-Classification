Welcome to
Amlwch History
Amlwch is a small village on the North East tip of the Island of
Anglesey off the North Wales coast.
In the 18th & 19th century the copper mines on parys mountain were
the largest in the world, with copper being exported to many
countries from the small harbour at Amlwch port.
The need to export the ore resulted in the development of the port
from a small fishing harbour to a location for the repair and
eventual building of new ships.
This in turn  resulted in the growth of smaller industries in
the area and the migration of people to and from the area.
Even thought the mine and ship building industry is past it's peak
the legacy maritime and chemical industry continues to survive in
the area.
Some of the industrial and social history of the area can be seen
from this web site. For more information please select from the menu.
