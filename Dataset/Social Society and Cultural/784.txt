Welcome to the Save Our Parsonages website.
SOP was set up in 1995 to oppose the sale by
the Church of its traditional rectories and vicarages. It opposes
such sales on pastoral, practical, and financial grounds, as well as
for community and heritage reasons.
Traditional rectories and vicarages are part
of our ecclesiastical heritage, just as much as churches, and they
are also major resources for the Church. They are focal points for
parish and community life. SOP's objectives are therefore based on
the tripartite argument of mission, community and heritage.
The economic arguments for retaining these
fine houses are equally strong. Sales bring short-term gains for the
Church but long-term losses.
Clergy and parishioners alike regularly find
themselves linked in opposition to ill-advised sales forced on them
by remote diocesan representatives. SOP responds to requests for
help and advice from parishes up and down the country when
threatened with the disposal of their parsonage by their diocese.
Our objectives are:
To encourage the Church to retain, use,
value and maintain its historic rectories, vicarages and
associated buildings and to recognize them as important assets
and as fundamental to its mission;
To provide support and advice to parishes
and communities that seek to retain their historic parsonages;
To research, study and promote
understanding of the role of the traditional parsonage in the
life of the clergy and the community at large;
In these ways, to facilitate the mission of
the Church
SOP has a committee which holds regular
meetings throughout the year, and our AGM is held at a traditional
parsonage each year.
