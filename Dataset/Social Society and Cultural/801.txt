The South Wales Record Society
The South Wales Record Society was established in 1982 and exists to
publish a regular series of texts and other works relating to the
history of South Wales, and in particular to the historic counties of
Glamorgan and Monmouthshire.
Such publications allow original source materials that would otherwise
only be accessible in archives and libraries to be examined by a wider
readership. Each text is provided with a scholarly introduction, notes,
bibliography, and other glossaries and appendices which enable the
original source to be placed in its historical context.
For
a subscription of £20 payable annually in April, members of
the Society, either individuals or institutions, are entitled to a
complimentary copy of the current year's publication and to be kept
informed of new publications and of
the Society's meetings.
Recent publications
No. 29, I hope to have a good passage...: the business letters of Captain Daniel Jenkins, 1902-1911, edited with an introduction by David Jenkins, was launched on 10 December 2016 (pictured right).
This
volume comprises the text of a 500-page copy letter-book kept by
Captain Daniel Jenkins (1871-1922) between 1902 and 1908 and in
1910-11, during periods when he was in command of several Cardiff tramp
steamers. These letters are probably unique as it seems likely that
they are the sole remaining first-hand record of the trades plied by
such vessels in the early twentieth century. Read more...------------------------------
No. 28, Cas Gan Gythraul: demonology, witchcraft and popular magic in eighteenth century Wales. By T.P., edited by Lisa Tallis.This unique, relatively
short, text offers the fullest treatment of witchcraft in Wales in the
vernacular, during the early eighteenth century.
The author shares his own experiences and beliefs and those of his
neighbours and acquaintances, by relating his conversations to the
reader, giving his work a rich and authentic feel.
Our first bilingual publication, the book was launched at Swansea
Museum on 24 October 2015. The editor is pictured here with her family
at the event. Read more...
