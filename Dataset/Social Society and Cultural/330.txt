"Black History is the perfect opportunity to be curious about who you are."
"A people without the knowledge of their past history, origin and culture is like a tree without roots."- The Rt. Hon. Marcus Garvey
"Culture is a process which gives a people a general design for living and patterns for interpreting reality" - Wades Nobles
"To illuminate our real African History, to clarify our African Present, to brilliantly project our African Future" - Mama Kefa Nephthys
Welcome to Black History Studies
Educating the community to educate themselves
Black History Studies is a social enterprise company which aims to empower the African and Caribbean community and enable them to develop self knowledge and identity through Black History and Culture. Black History Studies aim to provide a wide range of courses and activities which will provide people with the opportunity to pursue their interest in Black History and Black Studies. We also aim to provide high quality courses and activities that can be accessed by all within the community.
We believe that Black History and Black Studies should be studied throughout the year and not just during Black History Month held in October. El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz (Malcolm X) said that "Education is your passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today". Black History Studies supports this view and encourages people to learn about Black History and Culture and use it to develop their lives and others.
Our Mission
Our mission is to inform, inspire and empower people through Black History and Black Studies by educating the community to educate themselves thereby creating a self-sustaining learning circle.
Black History Studies is dedicated to providing you with a high quality and professional service and can offer services such as:
Black History and Black Studies Presentations
Short courses on Black History / Black Studies
Beginners and Advanced Black Studies Courses
Museum Tours
Film Screenings through our Community Cinema
International Study Tours
Publications and Audio Lectures
