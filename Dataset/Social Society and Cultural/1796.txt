Transform
We are a Quaker trust which supports people who address
the root causes of conflict and injustice.
Strategy
We fund work under four main themes: Peace & Security,
Power & Accountability, Rights & Justice, Sustainable Future.
We fund across the UK, including a dedicated programme in Northern Ireland.
We also make a small number of grants for work at a European level.
Change
We recognise that change can take many years to achieve
and are willing to take the long view, and to take risks.
Support
We aim to be a responsive funder, happy to support our grantees
to help them make the difference they want to make.
Values
We aspire to place Quaker values of equality, truth, peace and
sustainability at the heart of everything we do.
