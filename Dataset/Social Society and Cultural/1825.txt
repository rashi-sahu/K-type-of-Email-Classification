More than one billion people with disabilities, 15% of the world’s population, make up one of the most disadvantaged and marginalised groups within society. They are routinely denied their most basic human rights — cut off from education, employment and healthcare. Many live in extreme poverty.
Girls' Education Challenge project in Kenya
Disabled girls are often the least likely to attend and complete their education. Find out about our Girls' Education Challenge project in Kenya:
Bridging the Gap
Our ambitious five-year international strategy aims to enrich lives and promote independence for more than 100,000 people with disabilities across Africa and Asia.
We have set ourselves five targets for 2020:
developing models of inclusion through our inclusive education and livelihoods programmes
influencing policy for greater inclusion and rights for persons with disabilities
undertaking research on poverty and disability
promoting youth leadership amongst persons with disabilities
contributing to a stronger disability movement, in particular strengthening our Global Alliance network
Our countries of focus are Bangladesh, China, India, Kenya, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. We have established local partners in these countries whom we have worked with for a number of years.
