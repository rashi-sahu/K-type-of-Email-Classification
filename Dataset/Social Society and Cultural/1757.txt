Less crime
We ensure that children in trouble with the law are kept safe and not made the adult criminals of tomorrow. Thanks to our work with the police, the number of child arrests fell by 59% between 2010 and 2015.

Safer communities
We work to make our communities safer and promote lasting solutions to crime. Our legal work has improved the law and secured support for young people when they are released from custody.

Fewer people in prison
We campaign to reduce the prison population and to change prisons. From challenging restrictions on prisoners reading books to ground-breaking research on sex behind bars, the Howard League is the leading voice on what should happen inside prisons.
