Working for families in the UK
1 in 4 children in the UK are growing up in poverty. It doesn’t have to be like this.
We work to understand what causes poverty, the impact it has on children’s lives, and how it can be solved – for good.
We also provide accurate information, training and advice to the people who work with hard-up families, to make sure they get the financial support they need.
