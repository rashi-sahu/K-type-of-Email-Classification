Welcome to Mines and Communities (MAC)... website, published by a unique network of indigenous and solidarity NGOs, representing many thousands of people directly affected by the mining industry.
Nico Delamente (27) was murdered by unidentified gunmen riding a motorcycle on Friday, Jan. 20, in Claver, a mining town in Surigao del Norte region, The Philippines. As a leader of the Mamanwa tribe, he was an outspoken critic of the various large-scale mines owned by Nickel Asia, Sumitomo and other companies operating on their ancestral lands.

MAC was launched in 2001, and its priorities are governed by an editorial board, under our foundation statement, the London Declaration.
We provide communities, NGOs, activists, the media - and the general public - with information about many aspects of global mining and its impacts.
New articles are added regularly - please refer to latest headlines on the right of this page. Click on the thematic buttons (above & on the left) to browse through over 13 years-worth of news articles, analyses and opinion pieces. Or use the search engine.
If you feel able to support us, or for any other comments, we'd be delighted to hear from you.
