Socialist Worker’s idea for a jubilee gift
Published Tue 17 Jan 2012
Issue No. 2286
Top Tory ministers think we should buy the royals a yacht as a “gift” to celebrate this year’s diamond jubilee.
The cost of the yacht is estimated to be around
£60 million.
A guillotine, made simply of wood, a metal blade and a rope, would be far cheaper.
Socialist Worker suggests this would be a far more fitting tribute to the royal scroungers.
