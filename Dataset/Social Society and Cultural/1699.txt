Click on the image below to see what we do and why it works
By training communities to use their natural resources efficiently ...
even in such challenging environments
Careful homestead planning ....
can lead to productive diversity for home use.
... providing food for the family.
Home gardens begin like this ....
and with hard work, evolve in to edible landscapes.
By protecting and enhancing soils, this plot ...
was transformed in to this.
No expensive fencing required
Just skills and resourcefulness ....
... can grow in to harvests like this.
Learning to process and store excess produce
means that food can be enjoyed all year 'round.
while providing essential income for a more secure future.

Skills & EducationWe work with schools, training organisations and institutions to promote responsible stewardship, and enliven learning to enable children and their teachers to attain their goals.
