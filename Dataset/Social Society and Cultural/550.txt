About the Festival
The recorded history of Talgarth reveals that since 1292, when Bishop of St David's granted the town market and Fair Rights, there have been annual gatherings in the town. The current Festival follows this tradition celebrating the 20th anniversary of it's latest reincarnation in August 2015.
Talgarth Festival of the Black Mountains is a 'free' summer festival located all around the small market town of Talgarth in Mid Wales. Based on the Market Square, it caters for a variety people, ages and interests.
A true celebration of food, farming, music and the countryside. We remain one of the few Festivals who provide free entry, free parking (in the Main Car Park) at the end of the High Street and, on the whole, free entertainment. So please do take some time to browse our programme, it may just be worth your while.
