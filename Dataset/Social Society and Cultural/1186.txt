Blanche Parry accompanied her aunt, Lady Troy, to the Tudor Royal Court. King Henry VIII appointed Lady Troy as Guardian / Lady Mistress to his children, Princess Elizabeth and Prince Edward; she supervised Princess Mary when she lived with them.
Blanche, close to Queen Elizabeth I for 56 years, was pre-eminent at the centre of the Elizabethan Court. Lord Burghley was her friend and cousin.
‘Mistress Blanche, Queen Elizabeth I’s Confidante’, the first Biography of
Blanche Parry, and of Lady Troy, was published for the 500th anniversary of Blanche's birth. Copies available, from
time–to–time, on: amazon.co.uk.
Otherwise, the text, without illustrations, can be obtained from www.lulu.com –
the link is here.
Beautiful, superb quality, pictures, with text, based on this book are available in ‘Blanche Parry & Queen Elizabeth I’.
To augment both books, this website is hosting additional research, including:
Further Evidence for Blanche’s Rôle;
Papers.
The Epitaph was composed by Blanche herself for her monument in Bacton Church, Herefordshire. The Bacton Monument is now securely dated to before November 1578 and so is the earliest known depiction of Queen Elizabeth I as an icon, as Gloriana. This is, therefore, nationally important. Compare with Blanche's St. Margaret's Epitaph in St. Margaret's Church, Westminster (see Biography page 136).
The Papers page includes:
Lady Troy & Blanche Parry (Society for Renaissance Studies);
Blanche’s Yorkshire Tenants / Fieldnames from documents;
9 Welsh Bardic Poems relevant to Blanche's family & notes;
Parry Lands with glossary;
Harri Ddu ap Gruffudd's cupboard panel.
If you have additional research that is accurate, referenced & relevant it may be
considered for inclusion under your name - please contact the webmaster. Thank you.
