Working with Public Health England, NHS Digital has published the first findings from the new Learning Disabilities Health and Care dataset.
This dataset which draws anonymised, non-personal data from GP practice information systems provides information about the structure of the population of people with learning disabilities known to their GP in local areas and details of the frequency of major and common health problems and the care they receive for them.
