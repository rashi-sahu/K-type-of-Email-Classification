Pulsatile tinnitus and Tinnitus Control
Oct 02, 2016
Pulsatile tinnitus is a special form of ringing in the ears, that, instead of having a consistent noise or zing, is more of a pulsating sound. Given it's name this probably does not come as a surprise. It can be no less painful for sufferers nontheless, so there has been a lot of research in the medical field on how to treat this disease and find pulsatile tinnitus cure. Just like the usual forms of tinnitus, this is rarely fully curable and one can only hope to decrease the symptoms. It is often difficult to pinpoint the causes, as there are so many different possibilities. If there hasn't been any physical damage to the ear, it is most likely that the tinnitus has been stress induced and less aggressive medication can be given a try such as Tinnitus control. When it comes to damage to the inner ear, one has to differentiate between a one time blow, such as an explosion, or applied pressure (e.g. when diving), or a repetitive strain due to consistent stressors such as construction noise or loud techno music.

What contactlenses to wear if you have dry eyes?
Oct 02, 2016
I used to wear glasses for almost a decade when I decided that this not acceptable anymore, due to fashion related reasons. I know, there are fashionable glasses, and some people might even look good with them. Some even wear them even though they don't actually need them (I believe they are called hipsters). But for me it just doesn't work. Must be due to my facial bone structure or something, I don't really know. Anyways, so when I started wearing contact for the first time I was super happy, but after just a few hours I noticed that my eyes started to itch more and more. It was almost unbearable after a while and I had to take them out again. I went to an eye specialist and he told me that I have exceptionally dry eyes that make it basically impossible for me to wear contact lenses more than for two hours or so. Apparently I am suffering from keratoconjunctivitis sicca, also known as dry eye syndrome. Not sure what to do about it. There is special contact lens solution that I will give a try, as well as special contact lenses (read the acuvue oasys review for instance).
