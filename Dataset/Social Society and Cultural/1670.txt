New methodology and toolkit to support UNDP; the UN and national partners' response to complexity of health and development
The Institute of Health Equity at University College London has been working with UNDP and WHO to develop a methodology and toolkit to support UNDP; the UN and national partners to respond to the increasing complexity and interconnectedness of health and development by connecting the dots across the Sustainable Development Goals and putting people at the core of sustainable development. These cutting edge products are designed to help identify, conceptualize and strengthen potential and existing co-benefits for health and development and enable inter-sectoral and inter-Agency action on SEEDs of health and health equity
UNDP has launched the package of Strategic SEEDs publications (now available here) including:
SEEDs Equity Identifier – UNDP’s SEEDs of H/HE Screening Tool for Development Practitioners.
Guidance Note – On identifying and prioritizing SEEDs of Health and Health Equity using the SEEDs Equity Identifier – Part A.
SEEDs Glossary conceptualizes and defines all SEEDs of health applied in UNDP’s SEEDs of health and health methodology and toolkits.

Our latest report for the Department of Health is published: "Inequalities in Mental Health, Cognitive Impairment and Dementia Among Older People"
The likelihood of having good physical and mental health in later life in England is not evenly distributed across the population and there is a social class gradient in life expectancy, and disability free life expectancy.
This report focuses on inequalities in the experience and prevalence of poor mental health, cognitive impairment and dementia and the impact of social isolation, lack of mental stimulation and physical activity, before and after retirement, and in later old age.  These issues can exacerbate the risks of poor mental health, cognitive impairment and dementia in later life and are experienced disproportionately by people in lower socio economic groups.
This report was funded through the Department of Health and written by Sorcha Daly and Dr Jessica Allen.

A Lancet 'Film and Book' review by Michael Marmot, featuring Inequality: What Can Be Done? a book by Anthony B Atkinson, and The Divide, a film by Katharine Round
'Inspired by the seminal book, 'The Spirit Level' written by Professor Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett, and the inspiring work by Sir Michael Marmot and colleagues, The Divide is a film on the human impact of rising inequality on society.'
'Film and Book - Inequality - what to do and why' is Michael Marmot's review of Katharine Round's film, The Divide, and Anthony B Atkinson's book, Inequality: What Can Be Done?
In the review Micheal says 'Atkinson's Inequality is based on sound analysis with a social purpose. His 15 proposals would not harm prosperity but would give us a fairer, less unequal society with better health and lower crime rates. Worth discussing?'
And, 'Katharine Round's film The Divide is inspired by The Spirit Level. It provides texture to the book's arguments in the lives of people at the ends of the economic spectrum... The Divide features a young woman analyst who works in the financial sector who calls extreme wealth “f**k you” money—you have enough so that you feel you can disregard anybody. As she tells us, debt is what people need to manage their lives. For Wall Street, it is just a product to be bought and sold and make a profit.'

Michael Marmot Quoted in New Scientist Article
A quote from Michael Marmot was included in this interesting New Scientist article: 'World Health Organization wants to know how happy we are'.
The article discusses new ideas for measuring health and wellbeing across 53 European countries.
"The WHO is not abandoning traditional indicators of health. But by looking at how
culture impacts health, it may be possible to make further improvements.
Other researchers applaud the WHO’s objectives, but warn they won’t be easily met.
“Measuring subjective well-being in 53 countries is challenging because of cultural
variation, but potentially adds a new and different dimension to monitoring,” says Michael
Marmot of University College London’s Institute of Health Equity. “We should be wary,
though, of lumping ‘health’ and ‘well-being’ together, as their determinants overlap but
are not identical.”

A Game Changing New Book from Michael Marmot - Available Now - Sept 15
There are dramatic differences in health between countries and within countries. But this is not a simple matter of rich and poor. A poor man in Glasgow is rich compared to the average Indian, but the Glaswegian's life expectancy is 8 years shorter....
Health inequalities defy usual explanations. Conventional approaches to improving health have emphasised access to technical solutions – improved medical care, sanitation, and control of disease vectors; or behaviours – smoking, drinking – obesity, linked to diabetes, heart disease and cancer. These approaches only go so far. Creating the conditions for people to lead flourishing lives, and thus empowering individuals and communities, is key to reduction of health inequalities.
Michael Marmot addresses these health inequalities in his new book, 'Health Gap: The Challenge of an Unequal World' and demonstrates ways to make them smaller. The new evidence he offers is compelling. It has the potential to change radically the way we think about health, and indeed society.

Michael Marmot visited Zambia (July15) to discuss the role of the Government and theZambian Medical Association in addressing social determinants of health and increasing health equity in Zambia.
Of a population of 14.5 million Zambians, 2 million have no access to sanitation facilities. Practicing medicine under these circumstances is a challenge – not least because of shortage of human resources for health.

We can do better in building society
Michael Marmot has reviewed William Hutton's new book, at The Lancet.
"In his book 'How Good We Can Be', he writes with passion, controlled anger, and a good deal of evidence about the ills that beset British society in the second decade of this century. In his view, the UK has become a laboratory for a libertarian antisocial justice experiment based on neoliberal economics."

Lancet Perspectives: What kind of society do we want: getting the balance right - An essay by Sir Michael Marmot
Sir Michael Marmot has written a brand new essay, published recently by the Lancet. Here's a summary:
Laissez-faire is part of “the air we still breathe”, wrote John Maynard Keynes in 1926. “We do not dance even yet to a new tune.” Conservative individualism of 18th-century luminaries such as David Hume, conveniently underpinned by the supposed free market economics of Adam Smith, led to the view that enlightened self-interest operates in the public interest. Hence, leave things to the market. This idea appealed to businessmen, it seemed to have delivered prosperity, said Keynes, but unfortunately it was wrong: self-interest was not generally enlightened and can lead to great inequality, impairment of efficiency, and unemployment.

Natural Solutions to Tackling Health Inequalities
‘Natural Solutions to Tackling Health Inequalities’ report highlights the  evidence of the benefits of green spaces to health and wellbeing outcomes and the inequalities in use of, and access to, natural environments across England.
These inequalities  contribute to health inequalities. The report also proposes ways to improve access and use of green space, in order to improve health equity.
In the light of this evidence it important  to see the large variations between local authorities in the proportion of people using greenspace for health and exercise.  These were reported by the Institute of Health Equity in September 2014 and found on the report page.
Together this information presents real challenges for practitioners, academics and policy makers from across the health and environment sectors, at both national and local levels, to better utilise the natural environment to help tackle health inequality.

The Institute of Health Equity
We are very pleased to announce the establishment of the UCL Institute of Health Equity. This will build on previous work to tackle inequalities in health led by Professor Sir Michael Marmot and his team, including the ‘Commission on Social Determinants of Health’ and ‘Fair Society Healthy Lives’ (The Marmot Review).
The new Institute receives support from the Department of Health, UCL and the BMA. It will seek to increase health equity through action on the social determinants of health, specifically in four areas: by influencing global, national and local policies; by advising on and learning from practice; by building the evidence base, and; by developing capacity.
Current work includes leadership of a review of Social Determinants of Health and the Health Divide for the WHO European Regional Office, EU Reviews  and a programme of work in England to develop and embed social determinants approach to health inequalities in the health system and beyond.  Please see the 'Institute work' section for more details on the work the Institute is currently undertaking.
