WELCOME to the VALE of AYLESBURY METHODIST CIRCUIT (23/29)Charity No. 1134235The Vale of Aylesbury Methodist Circuit is a mutually supportive group of 18 Churches in the Vale of Aylesbury committed to a common purpose of channeling God's unchanging love for all people in our constantly changing world. The Circuit deploys a staff team of presbyters and lay persons -- under the leadership of Superintendent, Helen Kirk -- that work alongside numerous dedicated volunteers and in ecumenical partnership with churches from other denominations.And although our churches and chapels vary greatly in age, size and style of architecture all have things in common: a desire to follow Jesus Christ and and to share his love in the communities in which we serve. To this end we offer worship in different styles, opportunities to deepen and share faith and the chance to work together on different projects, along with a warm welcome and genuine friendship. So please take the time to discover more about us here or even better — come and see us in person! If you need help to log into or use the cloud please click or tap ...hereClick...HERE TO SEE THE LATEST CIRCUIT MAGAZINEFeatured articles
