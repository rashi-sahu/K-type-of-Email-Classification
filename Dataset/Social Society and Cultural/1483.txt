Our Mission
At Brathay we know everyone has the capacity to do extraordinary things that can inspire and benefit others. This drives our mission to improve the life chances of children, young people and families by inspiring them to engage positively in their communities. Read more
Our Approach
The experiences we create inspire children and young people to make positive changes that will last a lifetime. By focusing on the skills, attitudes and behaviours they need to develop their potential, their employability and their resilience, our approach empowers them to make active choices that will benefit them, and the people around them. Read more
Our Research
Research Hub is at the heart of Brathay’s practice. Our intention is to better understand, develop, evidence and influence practice and policy. We achieve this by exploring practice from within and working alongside practitioners and participants. At the heart of our approach is action research, which aligns with Brathay’s experiential, participatory and person centered learning and development practice. Read more
Fundraise
There are lots of fun and easy ways you can fundraise to support our work, such as organising raffles, bag packs, quiz nights etc. You could take part in an organised sporting event such as the Brathay Windermere Marathon, or even organise your own event, all while raising sponsorship for us. However you choose to do it, we'll be with you every step of the way. Read more
