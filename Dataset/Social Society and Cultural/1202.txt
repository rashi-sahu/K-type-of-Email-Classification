25th Chester (Oldfield)
& 1st Mickle Trafford Scout Groups
have amalgamated
The Cestrian Scout Group is located in the
Vicars Cross area
of the Ancient Roman City of Chester and has its own custom built Headquarters.The
Group is an amalgamation of the 25th Chester (Oldfield) Scout Group and the 1st
Mickle Trafford Scout Group. For the last 32 years the Group has taken part in JOTA which is the
International Amateur Radio Scout Jamboree on the Air. JOTA always takes place
on the 3rd full weekend in October and during that weekend we endeavour to
contact as many Scout or Non-Scout Stations throughout the world exchanging
ideas and making friendships. As a result of these activities quite a few
Scouts, Guides, Cubs, Brownies and other visitors have gone forward into the
hobby gaining an Amateur Radio Licence in their own right.
Over the Years we have contacted over 5,000 overseas stations in 185 different countries and many more contacts within the British Isles. We have a
very extensive collection of QSL Cards which have been received over the years
and we always send a QSL card to every contact we make and always reply to short
wave listeners who send us a report. Each year we design a badge for the event
and the full collection is displayed here.
