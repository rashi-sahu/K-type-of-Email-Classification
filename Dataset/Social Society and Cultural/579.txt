Freemasonry for women explained
Welcome to the website of The Honourable Fraternity of Ancient Freemasons.
The Honourable Fraternity of Ancient Freemasons (HFAF) is a fraternity for women and organised by women. It was founded in 1913 and membership is open to women of any race or religion, who are able to profess a belief in a Supreme Being. Freemasonry is one of the world’s oldest secular fraternal societies. It is concerned with moral and spiritual values. Its members are taught its precepts by a series of ceremonies.
Our Order has many lodges in the UK including the Isle of Man, and now as far as Gretna in Scotland and south to Bournemouth and westwards to the Cotswolds. We have four overseas Lodges: one in Gibraltar, two in Spain and one in Eastern Europe in Bucharest, Romania.
We are very excited about our University Lodges, Surrey Lodge No. 45 and Lodge of Wisdom No.55. Bourne Lodge 37 has decided to join the University Lodge Scheme too. We are also re-opening Centrum Lodge No. 46 later in 2016 to be another University Lodge. We are working in conjunction with United Grand Lodge of England, (masculine Freemasonry) to promote Freemasonry in our Universities.
We are planning to open a further Overseas Lodge in New Delhi in India at the end of 2016. We are working on enquiries from Kingston Jamaica, Edmonton in Alberta,Canada and New York in the United States.
We have tried to provide as much information as possible in our pages, but if you have any questions which haven’t been answered please use our contact form or email us on info@hfaf.org
