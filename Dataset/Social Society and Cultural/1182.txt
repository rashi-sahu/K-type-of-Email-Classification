Have your say
A SINN Fein member of Belfast City Council says his support of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee should be seen in the context of forthcoming centenary celebrations such as the 1916 Easter Rising.
Councillor Conor Maskey and his party colleague Jim McVeigh have backed a report detailing the council’s plans to celebrate the Queen’s 1952 accession to the throne at the beginning of June.Speaking to the News Letter, Mr Maskey said he hoped the move would be received in the “positive light it was intended”.
“This is significant step forward in how we work together in the council,” he said.
“We took this decision not just as an act of generosity but to show that we are conscious of how important the Jubilee is to the unionist community.“Equally, we are in a process where all the parties must show that they are conscious of how important other anniversaries, like the centenary of 1916, are to the people of this city.”The projected cost of the Queen’s Jubilee celebrations in Belfast is £56,000.Alliance councillor Máire Hendron welcomed Sinn Fein’s support.
She said it “sends out a very strong message of co-operation and partnership at council level”, adding: “I hope this positivity continues.”
