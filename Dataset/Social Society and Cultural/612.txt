Diamond Jubilee 2012 – Kingswood Celebrations
Friday 1st June – Tuesday 5th June 2012
The Diamond Jubilee was a true party in Kingswood, with events spread out over 5 days.
Events that took place around the weekend were as follows:-
The Derby, on Saturday 2nd June, attended by Her Majesty The Queen.
Open Gardens throughout the village on Sunday 3rd, encouraging people to get to meet old friends and new.
A Flower Festival and Concert at St. Andrew’s Church in aid of The Children’s Trust and NSPCC – open on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and with cream teas and a cake stall on Sunday.
A Street Party – held in Waterhouse Lane on Monday 4th June, opened by Tim Vine. The road was closed between the Village Hall and Boscoreale. There was a variety of music, different food and drink to buy, and activities and competitions for everyone including face painting, a children’s Kings and Queens Fancy Dress parade, a balloon race, a display of photographs and memories in the Village Hall, and a cake decorating competition.
The Kingswood Lawn Tennis Club ran a tournament on Tuesday 5th June.
Support for the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in celebrations was magnificent, and residents participated in large numbers in all aspects of the weekend – from a Concert and Flower Festival in St Andrews Church, to Open Gardens, a Street Party and a Tennis Competition and hog roast. Attendance at the Street Party was beyond the organisers’ wildest dreams – with around 2,000 adults, plus children, who enjoyed music, food and drink, stalls, competitions and many other activities for all ages.
The community was not only been able to enjoy themselves throughout the weekend but were also to be able to reach out and help others – and as a result of the weekend the village were able to donate a total of £9239.27 to the two chosen charities, The Children’s Trust and the NSPCC. This was presented to representatives of the two charities by the chairman of the organising committee, Councillor Simon Parnall.
