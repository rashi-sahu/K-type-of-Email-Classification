Cwmbrans War Dead
Cwmbran and
District's
War Dead
Dedicated to the war dead  of Cwmbran and district, Monmouthshire
The names in this database have
come from the various war memorials in and around Cwmbran and in due
course and with further research more names will added that have no
memorial.
Any help in adding to these
names or photographs and information about the casualties is very welcome.
The lists
under the letters below gives the
Surname, Christian names, Age, Date of Death,
Service, Number, Rank, Awards (in bold text), Next of Kin, where buried or where listed on a
memorial, grave number or plaque number and where else listed on a local
memorial ie. school.
All the information is as known and will not be
complete and I would welcome further information about any of these
persons.

claiming my photographs as a resultof their own research.
