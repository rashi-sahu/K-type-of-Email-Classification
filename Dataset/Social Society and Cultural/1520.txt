Hello.
We're Eddie's and we're a local charity. Our name is new but we're not. We've been supporting people with learning disabilities in Cambridgeshire for over ten years. We used to be part of Cambridgeshire Mencap, which is why you'll sometimes see that name mentioned on our website. Eddie's provides a wide range of services for children, young people and adults with learning disabilities, and their families and carers. We offer practical support and lots of exciting opportunities. But don't take our word for it - have a look around!VolunteersA little of your time could make a big difference to someone's lifefind out moreWork for usAre you ready to change your life and help other people change theirs?find out moreDonateAnother way to give monthly.find out more
