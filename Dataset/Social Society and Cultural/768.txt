HomeThis website is dedicated to all the men and women who sacrificed their lives so that we may live and enjoy our freedom today.
Remember the Fallen is the result of many years of research into the names recorded on Worcestershire war memorials and rolls of honour/service covering all conflicts.  While the majority of these war memorials and rolls of honour/service are in Worcestershire, there are a small number from Warwickshire, Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire and Birmingham.
Information on any of those named on this website is always most welcome, please email us via the Contact Us link on the left.
