The Migration Museum Project plans to create the UKâ€™s first dedicated Migration Museum and to tell the story of movement into and out of the UK in a fresh and engaging way.
The museum will be an enquiry into who we are, where we came from and where we are going. Britons at home and abroad have a shared cultural history and an exciting future. We aim to represent the individual stories, the emotion and the history that have gone into shaping our national fabric; we aim to be the museum of all our stories.
