The Royal Visit
It gave me immense pleasure to welcome Her Majesty The Queen to De Montfort University in her Diamond Jubilee year.
Our university is incredibly honoured to have been chosen to mark the start of The Queen’s tour of the United Kingdom to celebrate her magnificent reign.
We are also immensely proud that Her Majesty was accompanied by His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh and Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge.
The celebration was history in the making, not just for De Montfort University, but also for the people of Leicester, and I have no doubt memories of this important occasion will be cherished, for years to come, by all who witnessed it.
The excitement and anticipation that was felt around our campus when the visit was first announced is a measure of the great affection our students and staff have for The Queen.
Our celebration showcased the passion, commitment and spirit of innovation which exemplifies DMU and shows why we are a university of quality and distinctiveness.
