CRUNCH TIME IN THE SUPER FIVES!
What a thrilling conclusion is guaranteed when both the women's and men's Super 5s reach their finale weekend at Gloucester's GL1 Pool on 18/19 March! The situation in both competitions could hardly be more open after the latest round of matches at Lancaster. It looks like this:​Women: City of Manchester hold a narrow one-point lead over champions Liverpool Lizards and Otter - but still have to play both their rivals.​Men: Leaders Cheltenham are two points ahead of Lancaster - who they face in their opening match at Gloucester.The latest round of Super 5s fixtures at Lancaster saw Otter women battle very much back into contention when a goal just six seconds from the end by Cicely Turner earned a 6-5 victory over Liverpool. It was the Lizards' first Super 5s defeat in three seasons.Cheltenham, men's champions for the past two years, would already have one hand on the trophy once again but for their day one defeat by Solihull. But they put their title bid back on course with a 16-9 defeat of Caledonia.Rotherham Metro lead men's Championship 4 with a perfect record from five matches. See news and fixtures pages for all the details.​​​​​​Action photos above (by Trevor Hyde) are from recent matches. L-R: Chris Icely (Polytechnic), Henry Redman (Cheltenham) and Sarah Connolly (Otter).​
