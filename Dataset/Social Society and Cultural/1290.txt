Commonwealth experts agree a manifesto to step up efforts to preserve the sight of people with diabetes
In October 2016, professionals from the diabetes and eye health
sector came together in Durban, South Africa, for a three-day Symposium hosted
by The Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust and the International Centre for
Eye Health, to strengthen current approaches to tackle blindness from diabetes.
As rates of diabetes reach epidemic levels globally, diabetic
retinopathy – a complication of diabetes which if left untreated can cause
irreversible loss of sight - is predicted to become the leading
cause of avoidable blindness in working age adults. Over 100 experts from 30
countries across the Commonwealth came together in Durban to explore how to
ensure more people with diabetes in the Commonwealth and beyond can access
effective screening and treatment to prevent them from going blind as a result
of the disease.
Eye health and
diabetes specialists, ministries of health and international NGOs examined the
progress and lessons so far of the Trust’s programmes to tackle diabetic
retinopathy across the Commonwealth. Delegates also discussed how to help
secure key policy changes and carried out macro-planning of national services
to tackle the condition, against the backdrop of the Sustainable Development
Goals and health service strengthening.
At the end of the three-day Symposium, a
landmark manifesto was developed and agreed by delegates that outlines the key
principles of a cost-effective and efficient diabetic retinopathy screening and
treatment programme that could be built into the public health system at every
level. The eight principles are:
Universal
treatment where everyone with
diabetes has access to advice and treatment for diabetes, regular screening for
diabetic retinopathy and timely access to affordable treatment.Patient-centred
care where all people
with diabetes are supported, together with their family and community, so they
can improve management of their diabetes to reduce the risk of complications,
including retinopathy.   Evidenced-based
approaches where information
and learning is shared to improve models of care in relation to their coverage,
efficiency, cost and effectiveness.Quality
service where standards,
guidelines, measures and quality assurance are developed and endorsed to
deliver quality and integrated care.Integrated
service which promotes
improved self-management of diabetes and for the detection of diabetic
retinopathy to be integrated into holistic care of people with diabetes,
whether through government, private or NGO services at all levels of care.Appropriate
human resources where staff
implementing the programme have received the appropriate training,
accreditation and ongoing professional development and are distributed
equitably, so that a safe and quality service is provided.Accessible
where services are
available, affordable, appropriate, safe and integrated where possible with care
available to all people with diabetes.Cost
effective and sustainable where resources– staff, equipment and technology,
venues, medication - that are the most cost effective for that setting and
which maintain standards of care and access are used.
The aim of the manifesto is to serve as a common
platform for all those wishing to strengthen services to prevent diabetic
retinopathy across the Commonwealth, so that a consistent and comprehensive
message is delivered reflecting best practice. At the Symposium, delegates
discussed how they would use the manifesto to build momentum and achieve
progress for the benefit of people with diabetes now and in the future.
This includes working with UN specialised agencies
and other international organisations, regional bodies, national and local
politicians, Commonwealth ministries of health, professional bodies, training
institutions, health workforces diabetes associations, the media and others to
raise awareness about blindness from diabetes and what is needed to prevent it,
and to encourage the integration of diabetic retinopathy services into diabetes
care.
Dr Astrid Bonfield CBE, Chief Executive of The Queen Elizabeth
Diamond Jubilee Trust, attended the symposium and said “I am delighted that experts from all over the Commonwealth came together
to discuss and agree a way forward for how we can as an eye health and diabetes
community stop people from going blind as a result of diabetes. Stepping up
efforts everywhere to prevent diabetes is crucial and urgent. I am convinced that with the energy and determination so evident at
the Symposium we can together make a real and enduring difference for the
people of the Commonwealth and stop this rapidly growing form of avoidable
blindness in its tracks.”
