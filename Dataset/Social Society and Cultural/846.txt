Welcome to Torbay Connected
Legible places are successful places. Torbay Connected aims to use a framework of natural legibility to form the basis of place enhancement through art and cultural commissioning and development.Through integrating cultural projects into our buildings and spaces in a structured way we form a strong foundation for exploring and showcasing our rich of cultural, geological and social heritage that will help to promote distinctive and enjoyable places for both residents and visitors. The English Riviera Geopark lies at the heart of the identity of Torbay, the connection between humans and landscape is central to Torbay Connected.Within this site we set out:1. A map based legibility framework for our first area of focus (Torquay Harbour to Cockington)2. Guidelines for how Torbay Council expects buildings and spaces to contribute to our public realm to promote natural legibility.3. Guidelines for how to commission the work of artists and designers.4.  An interactive map based information resource of facts, stories and information about the Bay that we hope will be used by designers to contribute to making our buildings and public realm unique and distinctive.Ginkgo Projects Ltd is working in partnership with Torbay Council to develop and maintain Torbay ConnectedWe very much hope you will enjoy using Torbay Connected and will contribute you own information through the Your Place layer on the interactive map.
