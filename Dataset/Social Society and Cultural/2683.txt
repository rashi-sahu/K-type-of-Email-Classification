And the Examiner can today reveal the route the Olympic Flame will take through the town on June 24 and through Dewsbury and Batley on June 25. It will also be carried through Brighouse on the 24th. Details were also unveiled of some of the people chosen to carry the torch. They include Emley pensioner Pat Ainsworth, a veteran of 14 London Marathons, and Almondbury Downs Syndrome girl Joanne Kempley, an acclaimed actress and swimmer. Pat, 66, is one of the first Torchbearers confirmed to run in Kirklees. She was chosen because of her extensive charity fund-raising activities which have seen her raise over £120,000 from running marathons and taking part in major trek challenges in spite of having only one kidney and arthritis. She said today: “It is an honour and privilege to be chosen to take part in the Olympic Torch Relay in Huddersfield.” One of the inspirational Torchbearers running through Brighouse will be Joanne, 21. She was born with Down’s Syndrome and a serious heart defect, requiring open heart surgery when she was just six. But the actor with the Full Body and The Voice company leads a full and varied life and was recently appointed as ladies’ team captain representing Great Britain in the Down’s Syndrome World Swimming Championships in Taiwan, bringing home two bronze medals and one silver medal with the ladies’ relay teams. She said: “I’m so excited and proud to be running with the Flame through Brighouse. “I love sport and I really enjoy volunteering and working with the community. “I can’t wait to be part of the Olympic Torch Relay.” The Torch Relay arrives on New Hey Road, Outlane, on June 24 in a vehicle convoy and will be driven down New Hey Road to Marsh. At Reed Street it will be collected by the first of the relay team of Torchbearers at 11.51am and will be carried down Trinity St, past Greenhead Park, over the ring road and into the town centre. The runners will turn left on to Railway Street and into St George’s Square, left on to John William Street and right onto Castlegate. The run then goes left on to Bradford Road and on to Fartown Bar where it will be picked up by a convoy to be taken to Brighouse. The Brighouse route includes Huddersfield Road, Bethel Street, Briggate, Halifax Road and Lane Head. On Monday 25 June the Torch Relay route through Batley and Dewsbury starts from 9.15am. The route includes Scotchman Lane, Timothy Lane, Batley Field Hill, Mayman Lane, Clerk Green Street, Track Road, Halifax Road, Dewsbury ring road, Long Causeway, Rishworth Road and Wakefield Road. Clr Masood Ahmed, Kirklees Council Olympics and Paralympics Champion, said: “This is a fantastic opportunity for Huddersfield, Batley and Dewsbury residents and surrounding communities in Kirklees to see the Olympic Flame and witness the spectacle of the Olympic Torch Relay. “We are keen to encourage as many people as possible to bring the route to life and get involved by lining the streets to watch, with performances or by decorating the routes to make the whole day something really special and one to be remembered. “We also hope that local communities will plan celebrations in their own areas.” Calderdale’s Mayor, Clr Nader Fekri, said he was is delighted that the Flame is coming to Calderdale. “I’m thrilled that residents and members of our surrounding communities will have a once in a lifetime opportunity to witness the spectacle of the Olympic Torch Relay,” he said. He added: “We are very proud to celebrate the achievements of some of the most inspiring local people who will be running with the Olympic Flame, and we look forward to welcoming them to Calderdale.” Sebastian Coe, who chairs the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games, added: “Today we bring the Olympic Torch Relay to life. “The Flame symbolises the Olympic spirit and its journey around the UK will bring the excitement of the Games to our streets. “Now the people know the route the Olympic Flame will be carried along and the Torchbearers for their community, they can start planning how they might celebrate and make it Kirklees’ moment to shine”.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterFollow @ExaminerSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAlmondburyParalympic gamesOutlaneMarshLondon 2012 OlympicsKirklees CouncilHuddersfieldGreenhead ParkFartownEmleyBrighouseThe Voice
