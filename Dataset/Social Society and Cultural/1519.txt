So, what is a doorstep loan exactly?
A doorstep loan, or a door to door loan, is a type of personal loan. With these
types of loans, the cash is delivered right to you door by one of the lenders'
trusted agents. These agents will also come to your home when it is time to
collect payment. This means you can essentially complete the loan all without
ever leaving your home. This is perfect for someone who has trouble getting
around, or someone who is very busy and likes the convenience of having
everything done from their home. In addition to delivering and collecting
money, the agents will also work with you to plan out loan repayments and help
you if you are falling behind on your payments. They will know all the details
of your loan and financial history and so will be well equipped to help you
handle any issues that may arise.
If you work irregular hours and will
not be able to find the time to meet the lender's agent, you may want to
consider a different loan option. There are several other options online that
you can consider, such as logbook loans or online loans. If, however, you work normal hours and want the convenience
of having a loan agent coming to your home to handle everything, then a
doorstep loan is probably for you.
