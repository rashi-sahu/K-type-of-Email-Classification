Hello, we're Hoffi
An award-winning design agency based in Cardiff Bay. We work with businesses and organisations to develop brand strategies, brand identity and brand communications. Founded with a sense of fun, exploration, considered thought and experience, we produce outcomes that work socially, commercially and creatively.
About
Hoffi is a creative design agency that specialises in branding and brand development, using strategy and great design to achieve our customer’s goals. These goals vary from increased sales, greater staff retention through to more bums on seats, but they are always commercially focused.
We’ve built some great relationships since 2006 with many private and public sector organisations.
Relationships including developing and nurturing digital for Wales’ national theatre company; building brand strategies for the construction industry; and supporting the improvement of our transport infrastructure with Network Rail in Wales, to name just a few customers that we’ve listened to, questioned and guided through our design process in the last 10 years.

Our Process
DISCOVER
The Discover Phase is our opportunity to learn about your company and it's people, products and services. Using a number of creative tools and workshops.
MAP
The Map Phase begins to highlight opportunities that have arisen from the discover phase, understanding how these opportunities could relate to your market and/or customer.
CREATE
The Create Phase is where we begin to create the visual interpretation of your company's brand. Creating how it looks across different media, developing it's tone of voice and also looking at the the brand mark and it's typography.
GROW
Once the Create Phase has been created we then want to grow the brand and it's delivery with you. This work can include brand launches, extended brand guidelines, website design and development and general communication design.
