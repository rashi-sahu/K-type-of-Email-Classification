Who Am I?
What a question! My name is AndyPryke, I live in Moseley in Birmingham, England ( see map ).
Probably the most interesting thing on this site is my blog, it's regularly updated, and
deals mainly with the local art and music scenes, with the occasional speculation on technology, restaurant review or attempt at humour thrown in. I've also put together some of the things I enjoyed most in 2005. As for 2006, so far I've really enjoyed my visits to Vancouver and Reykjavik, and to the Big Chill, Summer Sundae and Edinburgh Festivals.
Some other random facts about me:
According to the Keirsey Temperament Sorter
I've got a ENTP (Extraverted iNtuitive Thinking Perceiving) personality type - this means I've an InventorPersonality - who am I to argue?
You can trust me - I'm a doctor! I have a Ph.D. in DataMiningUsingSymbolicGeneticAlgorithmsAndInteractiveVisualisation from the University of Birmingham.
I have an unusual surname Pryke, so I set up a Pryke's Page
I'm a member of Birmingham Friends Of The Earth .
I tend to use too many lists, dashes and brackets when writing online.
If you're looking to employ me, take a look at my CurriculumVitae.
What's on this site?
In addition to MyBlog, there's a lot of other stuff on this site. Some of it old, some of it new, though I tend to skip the borrowed and the blue.
