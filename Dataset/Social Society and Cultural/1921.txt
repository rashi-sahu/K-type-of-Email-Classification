Support for blind veterans
No One Alone Campaign
The Blind Veterans UK No One Alone campaign aims to reach out to the approximately 59,000 veterans in the UK who are eligible for free, lifelong support from us and most of whom are not currently receiving it.
"Blind Veterans UK have been marvellous,
just so supportive in every way."

With the No One Alone campaign, we at Blind Veterans UK want to let vision-impaired Armed Forces and National Service veterans and their families know that we are here for them. It does not matter when they served or for how long. Nor does it matter how they lost their sight. If they served our country, they do not have to battle blindness alone.Blind Veterans UK is here for them.
"As a supporter of Blind Veterans UK I realised that they didn't just support those blinded in conflict, so I got in touch"
Jim Hooper
Since 2012 the No One Alone campaign has been reaching out to veterans with severe vision-impairments who may not be aware of the support Blind Veterans UK provides. We work with a wide range of people who could come into contact with veterans such as local authority staff, NHS professionals and regional blind associations. The No One Alone campaign has a network of veteran volunteers who regularly attend events and speak about the support they’ve received from Blind Veterans UK. If you are a blind veteran, or a family member of a veteran, or a health and social care professional please get in touch.

Did you serve in the Armed Forces or do National Service?
Find out more about the support that we provide to vision-impaired ex-Service men and women.
Are you a family member of a vision-impaired veteran?
We know sight loss affects the whole family so we provide support to family members too.
Are you working with veterans or people with vision-impairments?
Can you refer vision-impaired veterans to our support and services?
The No One Alone campaign has reached out to many veterans and their family members. Of the veterans supported by Blind Veterans UK only 3% were injured in Service. Most of our veterans are over the age of 75 (87%) and lost their sight due to age-related conditions such as macular degeneration, diabetes or glaucoma. You can read some of their stories below.
