REALLY WILD FESTIVAL - CLARIFICATION
After much deliberation and consultation, it can be confirmed that Celtic Camping will not be hosting the Really Wild Festival in 2017.  After two outstanding years, the Director Ian Griffiths and his team have handed back full control to the co-organiser and founder Julia Horton-Powdrill in order to focus on the core business aspects of the site at Pwll Caerog the home of Celtic Camping and Bunkhouse Accommodation.
The multi award winning Really Wild Festival was founded in 2004, to provide a market place for local food and drink producers and traditional craftsmen in the most westerly part of South Wales. It offered an opportunity for producers and growers to showcase their products to businesses and visitors and most importantly, it encouraged more tourists into Pembrokeshire. It was held initially at Oriel y Parc, but the festival expanded every year and as the activities, attractions and environmental education side developed, it rapidly outgrew each new site.
'The Really Wild brand will continue to develop in diverse, innovative and smaller ways but still maintaining its original ethos,' said event founder Julia Horton-Powdrill, 'I shall always be indebted to the directors, and volunteers and more recently, Ian and his team at Celtic Camping who have all helped this amazing, friendly and popular event develop. The Really Wild Festival has been responsible for bringing thousands of pounds into the local economy each year, giving many people entertainment and pleasure and promoting the area far and wide. In these respects it did exactly what I had planned in my original dream.'
