How to appeal
Use the relevant form and guidance leaflet.
You must complete the whole form and attach a copy of the decision you are appealing against.
Email this to cst@hmcts.gsi.gov.uk or send it to:
Care Standards Tribunal
HM Courts and Tribunals Service
1st Floor
Darlington Magistrates' Court
Parkgate
DL1 1RU
Telephone: 01325 289 350
Fax: 01264 785 013
Emergency cases
You must also send a copy of the form to the regulator if your case is urgent, eg:
your registration is suddenly cancelled or suspended
emergency restrictions are placed on your independent school
You can find the correct address on the letter from the regulator.
These cases will be dealt with much faster than normal appeals.
Contact the tribunal if you don’t know whether your case is an emergency.
Help and advice
You may be able to get advice from:
Citizens Advice
your trade union
a professional association (eg the British Association of Social Workers)
The tribunal can help you complete the application form, but cannot give you legal advice.
How your case will be decided
The tribunal will arrange a conference call with you, the judge and the regulator, to discuss what steps you need to take before the hearing. This is called a telephone case management hearing.
During the call, you’ll usually decide when to:
exchange documents and witness statements
put together the papers for the hearing (the ‘bundle’)
Find out more about witness statements and bundles.
The judge will set a date and time for the hearing. The details will also be added to the list of hearings.
You can also ask the judge any questions about the process, or what to expect at the hearing.
The hearing
The tribunal will try to hold the hearing at a court or tribunal building near your home address.
It will be attended by:
a judge and 2 specialist members of the tribunal with professional experience
a clerk or usher
a lawyer from the regulator
your lawyer or other representative (if you have one)
witnesses for both parties
Members of the public can usually attend the hearing.
You will be given a chance to:
present your case to the tribunal
call witnesses to give evidence
highlight any important points at the end
The tribunal will write to you explaining its decision within 10 days of the hearing.
Appeal against the decision
If you think the tribunal made a mistake in the way it interpreted or applied the law, you can ask for permission to appeal.
Get legal advice from a solicitor if you need help.
Find out more about appealing to the Upper Tribunal.
If the tribunal made a mistake
You can challenge the decision if there was a mistake in the way the case was handled (eg you weren’t sent important documents).

You must apply within 28 days of receiving the decision.
