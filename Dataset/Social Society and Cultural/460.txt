A Warm Welcome to Cytûn's Website
Cytûn unites in pilgrimage those churches in Wales which, acknowledging God's revelation in Christ, confess the Lord Jesus Christ as God and Saviour according to the Scriptures; and, in obedience to God's will and in the power of the Holy Spirit, commit themselves to seek a deepening of their communion with Christ and with one another in the Church, which is his body, and to fulfil their mission to proclaim the Gospel by common witness and service in the world, to the glory of the one God Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
We strive to do this in a number of ways.

Welsh churches unite to protect economic and human rights during EU withdrawl.
An alliance of Welsh Christian denominations has drawn up a detailed list of economic measures and human rights for discussion during the Brexit process. The initiative, instigated by the Union of Welsh Independent Churches, unites the mainstream denominations in presenting a Christian perspective on the core issues that could impact on society during and after Brexit. In a submission to the Welsh Affairs Committee, the churches identify key policy issues, including the rights of minority and linguistic communities, agriculture and the environment and the future relationship with other nations and states.
