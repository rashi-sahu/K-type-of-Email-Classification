Story
Thank you for visiting our fundraising page.We completed our walk of 76½ kilometres of the beautiful West Highland Way, from Milngavie to Crianlarich, to raise money for EveryChild.The walk is now over, but we shall still be accepting donations - so please sponsor us now!Donating through this site is simple, fast, and totally secure.  It is also the most efficient way for you to sponsor us.  EveryChild will receive your money faster and, if you are a UK taxpayer, an extra 28% in tax will be added to your gift - at no cost to you.Across the world, 121 million children do not have the opportunity to go to school, and 246 million have to work to survive.  Children are being abused, exploited, or forced to live in appalling conditions that we can barely imagine.  EveryChild is fighting to change this.  EveryChild is committed to protecting the rights of the world's most vulnerable and marginalised children.  Across 17 countries, EveryChild works to protect the most vulnerable and excluded children, giving them the chance to grow up in loving families with a safe and secure future.  In all its projects, EveryChild aims to innovate to bring about lasting, positive change in partnership with communities and governments.Please sponsor us here online!Many thanks for your support.Dorothea, Frederick, and Christopher
