You haven't experienced 'Aber' if you haven't been to the 'Marine'
Located on the picturesque promenade of Aberystwyth, the Marine Hotel has opened it's door under the same Family for over 30 years, we are now welcoming the grand-children to the running of the hotel!  We are very fortunate to be located close enough to the town centre but away from the hustle and bustle of town life.
A visit to Aberystwyth wouldn't be complete without a visit to the Marine Hotel.  It's an iconic hotel that has hosted generations of students and parents, holiday makers, business travellers, conferences, weddings and parties - if only the walls could talk!!!  So when you visit Aberystwyth - make sure you come and stay with us for an unforgettable night and unique view of the Pier and Prom as the sunsets on Cardigan Bay.  If not call on a Sunday to enjoy the unrivalled Sunday Carvery or just pop in for a coffee or a meal before you go and 'kick the bar' at the end of the Prom.
Comfortable sea-view en-suite rooms
The Marine is an ideal place to stay while exploring this beautiful part of Mid Wales and what better way to enjoy the amazing sunsets over Cardigan Bay than in one of our many comfortable sea view en-suite bedrooms.
