Nearly 4 children in every UK class are now likely to have a mental health difficulty - and the problem is growing.
It's also a little known fact that children's well-being in parts of Cambridgeshire is amongst the very worst in the country.
Without specialist support, vulnerable children can go on to develop mental illnesses and anti-social behaviours, which puts huge pressures on local services and costs our community dear.
Blue Smile is a Cambridgeshire children's charity which provides counselling and support in schools to help children fulfil their true potential and have happier childhoods.
It can quite simply be life-changing.

School Head Teacher: "Observations of our pupils post therapy or mentoring shows that we have children who are able to maintain friendships ... They increase their social circle ... that impacts on their emotional wellbeing and their happiness levels, increases their chances of academic achievement, and increases their prospects for the future".

At a time of drastic service cuts, we rely on individual and corporate fundraising and donations.
Without this, children simply won't get the help they need to turn their lives around.
There are many fun ways to get involved which are not only personally satisfying but which make a vital contribution to the children in your local community. More >
Help us make a lifetime of difference to a vulnerable child by supporting Blue Smile's work today.
