Ageing Well at Home
Care & Repair England is a small, national charitable organisation set up in 1986 to improve the homes and living conditions of older people.
It believes that all older people should be able to live in a decent home of their own choosing.
It strives to:
Ensure that more older people can live independently and with dignity in their own homes for as long as they wish
Connect housing, health and social care in ways that improve older people’s whole quality of life
Work with older people to influence decisions about housing & the related services which affect their lives
Watch the film where older people describe their experience of home repairs and adaptations
