Preparing
for Adulthood and providing a Local Offer are key themes in Pennine. We are
often described as a college without classrooms where learning takes place through
hands on learning. Ofsted have described our college as Good with students gaining outstanding practical
skills.
Our Care Quality Commission report. Although this just refers to our residential side we aim to carry those same high standards across all we do at Pennine. The report highlights Pennine as Good across all areas.
Although
most of our students are day students Pennine offers an extended college
programme for full residential and weekly boarding options.
Pennine is
in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. We are within easy reach from both the M1 and M62. We are accessible for day students from Wakefield, Barnsley, Doncaster, Kirklees and south Leeds. Our site covers 58-acres, including farmland and horse riding facilities. We
have good access to public transport and
local amenities.
To find out more about us use the links above and to the left to navigate around the site. Why not follow us on facebook. Over a 1000 people viewed our video of newborn piglets!
There are a number of videos on the site which give a good flavour of Pennine. Our Craft Hub, Land Based Learning, Life in the Community and Volunteering.
