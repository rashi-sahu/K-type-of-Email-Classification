"St. John’s: helping people to meet Jesus"
Welcome to the website of St. John’s Parish Church, Coulsdon. As Rector
of St John’s, I hope you will find this site informative and helpful. St.
John’s is part of the Church of England and is a familiar landmark in Old
Coulsdon. It has been the parish church for this area for a thousand years.
Our aim is to help people discover and get to know Jesus. We believe he
lived and died and is alive today, and that through faith in him it is
possible to know the love of God as Father, and the presence of the Holy
Spirit making that love real. We express that aim in our worship, in our
care for people, in our links with the wider church, and through various
other activities which are described in this website.
We are a group of ordinary people on a journey of faith and discovery.
You are very welcome to join us as we travel on together.
Please help.
We meet in a building of great historic interest, but this means we
have to spend a lot of money on its upkeep, after financing the mission
of the church in the parish and beyond. If you would like to help us,
please click on the Just Giving™ logo below to help us. You can also
make a continuing contribution to maintaining the fabric of this
outstanding church or sponsor or become a fundraiser.
