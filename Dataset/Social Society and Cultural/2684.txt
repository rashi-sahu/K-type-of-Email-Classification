There are usually two diary events a month. We run regular Green Laning trips under the GLASS (Green Lane Association) code of conduct.
We undertake regular trips to 4x4 Pay & Play sites such as KORC Kirton Off Road centre, Frickley offroad, Fosse Crosse, Robinhood bay, Parkwood at Tong,
Bradford and Cowm.
We also visit various 4x4 shows and events such as the Land Rover Spring Adventure, the Total Off Road event and the Hull Motorshow.
