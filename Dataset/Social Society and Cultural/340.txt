You may be an outsider, wanting to know more about the village with the weirdest name in South Oxfordshire, or you may be a resident. In either case, we hope you will find something here to interest you.
Brightwell-cum-Sotwell is a village of picture postcard prettiness. Nestling in a hollow below Wittenham Clumps, it has at its heart the CAMRA award-winning Red Lion pub. Dotted along the narrow streets are picturesque black and white thatched cottages. There is a school and pre-school, four churches, and a village hall which houses a thriving volunteer-run village shop. The parish stretches to the edge of Wallingford, but the village values its separate identity.
In estate agents' jargon, this is a sought after village, but it is much more than a pretty face. People have lived and worked here for over a thousand years. Where our forebears tilled the land, we are now more likely to toil over computers. However, farming still has an important part to play in shaping the landscape, and we remain firmly in touch with our rural roots.
This is an area that has attracted artists, musicians, scientists and visionaries. Visitors come from all over the world to Mount Vernon, home of the celebrated Bach Flower Remedies. Wild flowers grown in the garden of Mount Vernon are still used to make the mother tincture of these homeopathic treatments, and their creator, Dr Edward Bach, is buried in St James's churchyard in Sotwell.Thanks to Keith Brooks for the photos of Wassailing 2017.
