WELL-BEING AND CHOICE
IN SERVICES
FOR OLDER PEOPLE
A
website for social care and health care which promotes service users' own priorities and
their well-being and quality of life
England's 2005
social care Green Paper, Independence, Well-being and Choice, offered
support for everyone who wants to see
community care for older people become:
-
more responsive to the priorities of each individual service user,
-
ready to address older people's well-being and quality of life,
-
more flexible and capable of meeting a wide variety of service users' needs.
This website
offers a base for publications, discussion and weblinks which
advance such aims and seek to make the personal care budgets, announced by
Putting People First in December 2007, a route to flexible, person-centred care for older people.

'Caring for the whole person: home care for
older people which promotes well-being and choice'
Complete
findings from the in-depth, final stage of the research project on
flexible, person-centred home care for older people, which was funded by the
Department of Health and conducted at the Social Policy Research Unit,
University of York, during 2001-2005.  This research gives practical
guidance for making home care more person-centred and supportive of older
people's well-being and for preparing for
transition to personal care budgets, the individual budgets announced by
Putting People First in December 2007. Click on the title for a link towards full

Reducing depression among
older people receiving care
A project in North Yorkshire which
demonstrated, through a controlled research trial, how a holistic,
person-centred approach by care staff can reduce depression and improve
well-being among older people
receiving care services.
While the test of this approach concerned
improving the well-being of depressed older people in care homes, the same methods
can be applied in other types of care service for older people.
