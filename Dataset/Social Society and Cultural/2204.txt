Got a teenager?
Parenting teenagers can be likened to a rollercoaster, with many ups and downs along the way. Some parents see changes in their teenager almost overnight whereas others may see a gradual change. Teenagers can also experience highs and lows through changes in their lives, both emotionally and physically. You may feel more anxious as your teen becomes more independent and it can become harder to give them advice. Parenting teenagers can be an enjoyable experience with a little bit of preparation and we offer a wealth of information on the different issues you might face.
