Welcome to the World of Go
Go is one of the world's great strategy board games and originated over 3,000 years ago in China. It is part of popular culture today in Japan, China and Korea, and known as Igo, Weiqi or Baduk respectively in these countries.
Go is a game for two players with just a few simple rules that is fun for all ages. You start with an empty board and then place pieces alternately, vying to map out more territory. However, if you overstretch, your pieces can be captured and taken off the board.
While strategy and tactical calculation both play a
part, intuition and judgement are at least as important; this is why only a
huge advance in AI has enabled computers to play Go at the top level.
Go also has a simple handicapping system that allows level play between players of widely different strengths.
Go provides almost limitless possibilities.
