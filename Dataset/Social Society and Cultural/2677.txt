Suspiciously seeking yoga teachers online?
It seems the world of yoga is not immune to hoax emails, scams, or dodgy dealings. In December I received an email asking if I offered yoga lessons online, either through Skype or Google Hangouts. I don’t even know what the latter one is, and have not used Skype in that way. Something about the…

Variety is the spice of life – and of yoga! (Guest post)
Read on for a guest post about going to different yoga teachers and what it taught the student, not just about yoga, but about herself. “In the 25+ years of my life that I’ve been practising yoga, I have always been quite a ‘monogamous’ student. In the various places I’ve lived, I have always managed…

Light-hearted yoga for the new year
The new year is often a time of renewed intentions to ‘do this’ or ‘not do that’ etc. It can be quite serious, and with grey gloomy weather and no more sparkly lights, I thought I’d start 2017 off in a more light-hearted manner after seeing two funny graphics online. I hope they lighten your…

Trees – real and in yoga
It’s National Tree Week here in the UK, from 26th Nov to 4th Dec, so now is an excellent time to plant a tree in your garden, or buy someone a tree for them to plant, or donate to charities who plant trees in the UK such as Trees For Life (who are restoring Scotland’s…

Controlled breathing for mental and physical benefits
Sometimes people say to me “Why do you teach people how to breathe in yoga? Surely everyone knows how to breathe?” The issue is not that we don’t know how to breathe but that we may not be breathing in a helpful way. Learning and practising different controlled breathing (pranayama) techniques can bring physical and…
Tonight’s class cancelled, sorry!
Apologies for the very late notice, but the heating has broken in Canolfan Padarn and so I need to cancel the yoga classes tonight (29th November 2016). Next classes 6th and 13th December.

Standards for yoga teaching or empire building?
Yoga was recently in the mainstream media (BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the Guardian, the Daily Mail and iNews) over a plan for national occupational standards for yoga teacher training in the UK. The media would not usually report something which sounds rather dry unless there was a controversy, but before I get onto all…

Chocolate meditation for chocolate week
It’s Chocolate Week from 10th to 16th October 2016 in the UK, and I thought this would be perfect timing to describe a meditation practice that almost everyone will enjoy, even if (or especially if) they haven’t done any meditation before, because it involves chocolate! And almost everyone likes chocolate. Plus dark chocolate may even…

Free relaxation tracks, including in Welsh
If you’re looking for free, good quality relaxation tracks to use at home, in English or Welsh, why not try these three tracks from Yoga i Bawb (trans: Yoga for All) a west Wales yoga group. The three available are: * Progressive relaxation – relaxing each part of the body in turn * Yoga Nidra…

Meditation – a beginner’s guide animation
I really love the simplicity of this video by Happify explaining the principles of meditation in a very simple way. It’s short, it’s simple, and it’s engaging. I like the graphics which show the gradual erasing of all the brain chatter as you breathe and meditate. It’s a really good video for anyone new to…

Singing for peace and justice – Côr Gobaith
There is much wrong with the world and society, at the local level as well as nationally and beyond. It is easy to fall into despair at local or international environmental destruction, human hatred for others and social injustice. Furthermore, on an individual level, we can sometimes think that our actions won’t count, or there’s…

International Day of Yoga 2016
International Day of Yoga (IDY) is on 21 June 2016, the second time the world has celebrated this UN day. And having such a day is a good opportunity to either practise yoga on Tuesday 21st, or maybe reflect on what yoga means to you. If you can’t get to a yoga class on Tuesday,…

Retreats and reflecting on practice and non-attachment
Going on a retreat can help you contemplate stuff and reflect on things, partly because you have physically retreated from your usual schedule, activities, connections (if you turn devices off!), and other distractions for the mind. A yoga retreat can also introduce us to new things to practise*, we may have the opportunity to practise…

Quick yoga computer games
Some people like yoga, some people like computer games, and some people like both! If you like yoga but not computer games (me), here are two very quick little computer games which you can play and have a giggle. They have been created by the same developer, who wrote one of them in a time-limited…

Yoga as the counterpose
When we have spent too long doing something, either physically or mentally, we need to spend some time ‘undoing’ or doing the opposite, in order to re-balance the mind and body. Spent all day sat at your desk, churning out a report? The body is probably desperate to move and get active. Had a long…
