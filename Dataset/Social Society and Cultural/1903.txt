Standing up for today's and tomorrow's pensioners
Uniting the Generations
In recent years, there have been numerous claims that Britain’s older generation has escaped austerity at the expense of the young. This view is both inaccurate and divisive. Today’s battles on behalf of pensioners will benefit future generations, and equally, pensioners must stand alongside today’s workers in defence of their jobs, pensions and the right to a decent period of retirement. You can buy a copy of the NPC's brand new pamphlet produced with Unite the Union which explains how the generations can campaign together to defend public services and the welfare state. To order copies priced £1 plus P&P; email info@npcuk.org.
You can also sign up to receive our monthly email Campaign! bulletin simply by emailing us at info@npcuk.org or you can see how to join the NPC on the Join and get involved page.
