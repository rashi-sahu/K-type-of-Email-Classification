Welcome. The Beaumont Society is a national self help body run by and for the transgender community. We welcome all transgender people and their partners, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, race, creed or colour and all varieties from the nervous newcomers to those who are experienced and confident in their preferred gender.
Together with our sister organisations, since 1966, we’ve been at the forefront of supporting the transgender community, together with their partners and families, as well as advising and training on transgender issues.
The Beaumont Society operates a national 24 / 7 information line. This information line contains the telephone numbers of all the societies regional organisers who are available to speak to for advice, details of where to go for a good night out - even a friendly ear to listen.
Information Line (24/7/365) 01582 412220
