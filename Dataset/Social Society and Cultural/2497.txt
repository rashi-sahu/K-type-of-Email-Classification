It was July 2012 and all eyes turned to London for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. And we didn’t disappoint. Everyone came together – athletes, volunteers, cheering spectators – to put on the greatest show on Earth.
But London 2012 was more than just those few weeks that captured the world’s attention. Back before the Olympic Park was even a sketch on paper, the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) set ambitious targets to ensure that London 2012 was a fully sustainable event, and as a Worldwide Partner of the Olympic Movement, we played a key role in helping to deliver that vision.
Our sustainability goals were about leaving a legacy of improved sustainable living in Great Britain for consumers, suppliers and Coca-Cola as a business. Here, you can find out more about just how we achieved that. The documents and videos below explain what we did across our priority areas of health and wellness, waste, carbon, and ‘doing more and going further’.

HEALTH AND WELLNESS
Offering Choice
Our aim was to offer the widest range of drinks we have offered at any Olympic Games, and we achieved that with a choice of 19 drinks, including water, juice and low/no-sugar variants.
About StreetGames
As part of our commitment to promote active, healthy living, London 2012 partnered with StreetGames a charity that brings sporting opportunities to teenagers in the heart of disadvantaged communities across Great Britain.
StreetGames Athlete Bursaries
We provided professional athletes with bursaries to get involved with and support community sports at a grassroots level.

The One Planet Centre
Athletes are inspirational role models. To empower them to be ambassadors for sustainability, we supported The One Planet Centre, a hub about a sustainable future at the heart of the Olympic Village.

Supporting Others Towards a Sustainable Future
Our sustainability goals for London 2012 were carried right through our supply chain and created a model for future event sponsors to measure and improve their social impact. Find out more.
