White Paper on Universal Credit
Inquiry status: Inquiry concluded, oral and written evidence published.
The Committee invited written evidence and held two sessions of oral evidence to assess the implications of the Government’s plans to introduce Universal Credit, to replace a range of existing benefits available to working-age claimants. The proposals were first set out in a consultation document and then in a White Paper. The Committee wished to hear the concerns of interested bodies in advance of the proposals being set down in the Welfare Reform Bill. The Bill completed its parliamentary stages in March 2012 and Universal Credit will be introduced from October 2013.
