Make 2017 the year of real democracy
By the Real Democracy Movement editorial collective
This will undoubtedly be a decisive year in the struggle for real democracy. The crisis of the system – political and economical – leaves us no choice but to act in an organised, collaborative way to create a different, truly democratic future.

The discussion continues on
the Real Democracy Movement website. Why don't you register your support and
