This dish has many descriptions varying from region to region. Some Northern regions call it ‘five minute potatoes’, in the West it may be called ‘roast potatoes and bacon’ and ‘the miser’s feast’ in other regions. This follows a slightly different method where the potatoes are cooked whole with layers of onion covered in water. Once the water is boiling bacon slices or a piece of ham are placed on top of the potatoes, covered with a lid and simmered until the potatoes are cooked when most of the water will be absorbed. The miser would eat the potatoes one day, mashed up in the liquid, keeping the bacon to be eaten the next day with plain boiled potatoes.
