Brecon Ringing Calendar
For people who wish to ring at any of the Brecon towers please click HERE to see what's going on.
Guild website
This is the revamped version of the guild website. All the usual stuff can
be found using the menu tabs above. The biggest change is in the
TOWERS page, with a map showing the widespread
and geographically uneven distribution of the ringable guild towers (for
those who didn't already know this!).
It is intended to put tower contact details on the TOWERS page.
Where
these aren't at present shown, please email
for the information. I should be glad if tower correspondents would let me
know if any corrections or additions are required.
This home page will be devoted to announcements and news items. Contributions
from tower correspondents and other guild members, including pictures, would
be welcomed.
Guild Peal Books
The guild peal books are in the process of being scanned and the results can be found in
the 'Peals' section here.
The relevent report from the
Ringing World is displayed
with each entry.
Central Council Review
An important review of the need and function of a central organisation for bellringers
is taking place and is due to report next May.
A short survey open to all ringers can be found
here.
It is very short so, in the interest of getting as wide a response as possible, PLEASE have a look at it.

2016 Striking Competition
The competition, held at St Mary's, Swansea, on July 9th, was judged by
Andrew and Gillian Knight. Two bands entered and the results were:
1st: Brecon (Plain Bob Doubles)
2nd: Sketty (Call Changes)
Leslie Evans Trophy 2016
The Leslie Evans Trophy for progress in ringing during the year was awarded
to Ellie Williams of New Radnor
Mr Charles Powell
Charles Powell was the first Guild Treasurer, occupying the post from 1923 to 1939.
On his retirement he was presented with a clock 'in recognition of his faithful service as Treaurer'.
His great grandson, Steve Hogg, provided the photos of the clock which has been restored and is
now 'working like a dream'.
