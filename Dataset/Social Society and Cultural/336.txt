The Request
"I want from the Trust, assurances
and proof that any organs or body parts that were removed from my sons body
at a post mortem were returned to his body for burial and not kept by the
Hospital Authorities"
Shaun McGuire - December 9, 1999

Please note that all official documents and letters that you can see on this
web site no longer exist in the archives of Gwent Healthcare NHS Trust due
to a "clerical error"
Martin Turner
and Gwent Healthcare NHS
Trust now renamed the Aneurin Bevan Trust adding an
insult to this man's name have policy of systematically destroying all evidence of anything that
they consider to be incriminating and that also includes patients records!
Destoying any records is a criminal offence but was
fully backed up by the Gwent Police when I asked them to investigate but
they found no incriminating evidence because senior police officers
pressurised the investigators not to pursue the investigation so that they
could protect their friends!Â  This was admitted to me by at the time
Sgt. Chris Watts of Gwent police, now Inspector who subsequently totally
denied the admittance.

All documents relating to a complaint I
have made under the NHS Complaints procedure.
Read the decision by the Wales Ombudsman
and its corrupt and biased findings.
Find out how they came to their conclusion without even interviewing one witness
involved. In fact they refused to interview any witnesses with the exception of one who was totally not involved with my complaint and accepted her views of how a person she had never met
and knew nothing about because she wasn't employed there at the time, would have carried out his investigation into my complaint.
Read how all the UK
National Health Service archived documents relating to my original request for information about my son
in 1999 and the first complaint I made
under the NHS Complaints procedure
in 1993, no longer exist as they were deliberately destroyed
by former employees of Gwent Healthcare NHS Trust and Gwent Community Health
Council.
They wanted no
documentary evidence to survive about my enquires and the destruction of
these documents are clearly a criminal offence!
I will name and shame all individuals
who has anything to do with my complaint and it will be fully backed up by publication of all the documents for you yourselves to decide.
