Brighton and Hove braced for surge of street party applications
12 comments
IT’S being billed as one of the biggest celebrations of the year.
But in Brighton and Hove there are just three street parties on the cards to mark the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.
The city council expects many more as the celebration of Her Majesty’s 60 years on the throne nears.
With little more than two months until the national holiday, bosses at Brighton and Hove City Council said they are bracing themselves
for a late rush of applications as communities come together and toast the Queen.
They add that it is not charging for road closures to make it easier and cheaper for people to organise events.
Coun Bowden said: “We’re trying to make it as easy as possible for people to celebrate the Jubilee.
“If they get in touch with the council in advance it will look after all the paperwork to ensure it is as relatively painless as possible so people can relax and have a great day.
He added: “In the run-up to the royal wedding, we had a large number of late applications for street parties, and we expect this to happen this year also.
“We will be advertising small-scale funding to support community groups wanting to put on celebratory events during the summer, now that we have confirmation of community funding budgets for
2012/13.”
In Mid Sussex 12 applications have been made, 11 of which are still pending approval.
In Lewes ten street parties have been confirmed.
Hundreds of street parties and fairs were held across the county to celebrate the Queen’s Golden Jubilee in 2002.
For more details email highwayevents@brighton-hove.gov.uk or call 01273 293366.
Those interested applying for funding can call 01273 290000.
Mid Sussex District Council, which can be contacted on 01444 477305, asks its residents to give it six weeks to process road closure
applications.
Worthing and Adur councils (01903 221226) will also waive the £100 fee providing forms are submitted before April 24.
Guidance on the Lewes District Council (01273 484420) website said forms have to be in eight weeks in advance.

The council are desperate for more road closures as this will cause more parking infringements which they can profit from.

Marxist = anyone who disagrees with you. You have to be more imaginative in your slurs, who knows what a Marxist is?
It would seem the Greens are making it easier to hold street parties by not charging for road closures.
“We will be advertising small-scale funding to support community groups wanting to put on celebratory events during the summer, now that we have confirmation of community funding budgets for 2012/13.”
I don't read flag banning other than in your deluded post.
Personally as a republican I shall be enjoying my extra bank holiday and will happily take part in a street party if I am invited. No doubt you will call me a hypocrite, but then you are a bit limited.

I think that you are wrong. In around some areas of Brighton & Hove there is a good community spirit. I have never been to a place with so many street parties and community activities. Certainly, at least as friendly as "up North" (is that Lewes and Hassocks?).

That, Sir! Is a top hole idea. One I would wholeheartedly support.
We MAY have the slight problem of getting it past..
a) Health and Safety..Public Food License, Hygiene..etc
b) The Fire Brigade..Ope Air Cooking!
c) The Police, they will want a cut as usual..
d) The Greens.. We might have to substitute a cabbage.
I suggest, due to the state of most of the roads we forgo Spit Roasting and use the PIT method. Cooking a whole lamb isn't the sort of thing we can just decide to do one morning. This is something that takes a good deal of planning and preparation. First of all, we are going to need a lamb, Obviously, Plan on about 4 to 5 pounds for each guest... Might need more than ONE!.. Once the lamb is cooked and carved you have just about enough meat for everyone.
Pit Cooking: The pit method requires a hole in the ground (as mentioned we are not short of them!) that is 4 feet by 4 feet and 3 feet deep. Line the bottom with rocks or bricks and build a fire in the pit the night before you have your feast. Let the fire burn down for about 3 hours then rake the coals to one side. Lay down wet burlap bags, then the lamb, then more wet burlap bags. Shovel the coals around the covered lamb and bury in the dirt from the hole you dug. Go to bed and by the next afternoon your lamb will be ready. I suggest we have this party over towards Hanover, they live like this most of the year anyway. (haha NOT IN MY STRETT THANKYOUVERYMUCH!)
Otherwise, I AM WITH YOU!
See you are the BBQ and of course the Barricades later..! I hope it is like the Silver Jubilee, we wandered around..drunk and in large groups, gate crashing every ones street party, loads of young totty, hammered.. hahaha Yes, Pillaged and plundered.. Happy Days,
..... God Bless you Ma'am

shame we just can't operate like we did in the old days without all these requirements for licences etc.. i've been flying the flags and putting up the bunting for these special occasions and i get no better feeling than seeing people enjoying themselves and waving the flag without the need for 'licences' it's far too politically correct these days i'm afraid
