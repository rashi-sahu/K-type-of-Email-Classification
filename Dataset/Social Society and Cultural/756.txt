Welcome to Quaker Quest
Quaker Quest aims to help you find out about the Quaker way of life. We have found that people enquiring about us want to experience Quaker worship, hear why being a quaker matters to us, talk to each other and us about it and get an idea what sort of people we are.Read more >
About Quaker Quest
A typical Quaker Quest evening includes refreshments, six seven-minute contributions from three Quaker speakers, some time for discussion/questions and a half-hour period of Quaker worship. We ask the speakers to address the topic from their own experience. Read more >
Exploring Quakerism
A good place to start is the Britain Yearly Meeting website. You can find your nearest Local Meeting there, read the whole of Quaker Faith & Practice, watch film clips, contribute to the online forum and become absorbed in a rich fund of material about Quaker life and work.Read more >
Welcome to Quaker Quest
Quaker Quest helps people find out about the Quaker way of life.
We do this by organising live events, hosting residential weekends in the Oxfordshire countryside, publishing books about Quakerism for newcomers, making videos of Quakers talking about their faith, and doing anything else we can to open Quakerism up to new generations of interested seekers.
Quakers are a religious group who have been around for about 360 years.
The stillness that is at the core of our worship is as needed today as ever, along with the spiritual and social values we have derived from it.
We will be as interested to learn how you feel about them as we will be in meeting you.
