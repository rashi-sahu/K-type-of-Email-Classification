Many men and women of distinction have either been born in
Barry, or have spent a significant part of their lives here. We

to affix Blue Plaques to houses associated with these people.
The public have nominated worthy individuals
of distinction who fit the criteria;

Barry or at least spent a significant part of their lives in Barry
should not still be living
must be persons of distinction who are regarded
as eminent by their peers and of whom Barry can be proud

A Ceremony took place on Saturday 21st November
2009 to announce the first 10 commemorative Blue Plaques to invited
guests which included relatives of those commemorated, as well
