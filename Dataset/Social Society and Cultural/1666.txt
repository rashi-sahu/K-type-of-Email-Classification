So what exactly is a
logbook loan? Here's how it works. With most loans out there, you use your
credit score as a way to let the lender know that you can be trusted to pay
back the loan. If your score is too low, then you have no way of proving this
to the lender. The lender will then want some other way to ensure that you can
pay back the loan. With a logbook loan you use your car as collateral to secure
the loan. You can usually borrow an amount that is up to half of your vehicle's
value, and then you work out a payment plan to pay it back.
Once you
have decided that you need to get a loan without the use of your credit score, there are several
reasons why you should consider going with a logbook loan. The first is that
they are very easy to get. There are not a lot of requirements needed to get a
logbook loan, usually just things like being a legal resident and owning a
suitable vehicle. It also does not take very long to secure a logbook loan. For
instance, with our site, once you complete the application, we will inform you
if your loan has been accepted and pay out the money within 24 hours. This
makes it perfect for people who are desperate for the money now and don't have
time to wait. Lastly, even though you are using your car for collateral, you
get to continue driving it for the duration of the loan. This means that your
daily life will not be interrupted just because you needed to take out a loan.
