RULES are being relaxed to allow people to have a street party to celebrate The Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.
So far NO-ONE in Milngavie or Bearsden has applied to have an official celebration of the monarch’s 60-year reign.East Dunbartonshire Council (EDC) is promoting The Big Jubilee Lunch on Sunday, June 3 - so time is running out.
The event, designed to get neighbours and friends to celebrate together, is an official part of The Queen’s Diamond Jubilee events programme.
To make it as simple as possible for individuals or community groups to organise their very own Big Jubilee Lunch, the council is making things easier for party organisers in a bid to encourage participation.Now, EDC will only need a week’s notice for a jubilee event instead of the usual six, it is waiving the normal £150 fee it charges and a formal temporary road closure order is not needed.Diane Campbell, head of corporate and customer services, said: “The Diamond Jubilee is such a special celebration for the whole country and we are happy to encourage the people of East Dunbartonshire to come together to mark the occasion with a street party. “Of course there are health and safety issues around public events like street parties and while there are still regulations in place for everyone’s benefit, we are making things simpler.”
If you are interested in hosting a street party, the council has issued the following guidance:Very lightly trafficked roads with two points of entry will be considered as being suitable to be closed for the event without the requirement for a formal road closure. Residents may use road closure signs and seven days notice is required to close a road. The organisers will need the written approval of all residents whose vehicular access arrangements will be adversely affected by the temporary road closure.
Access to all affected areas must be maintained at all times for emergency service vehicles.The event organiser will need to obtain permission from Strathclyde Police.Party hosts should hold third party insurance for the street party and must indemnify East Dunbartonshire Council against any insurance claims that may arise from any damage, injuries or accidents caused by or in consequence of the street party.No spikes or metal pegs should be driven into the road surface. Any damage caused to the road would require to be repaired at a cost to the event applicant. The disposal of hazardous materials into the road drainage system will not be allowed.To get things moving, the
event organiser must send an e-mail to roadservices@eastdunbarton.gov.uk or write to Roads & Neighbourhood Services, Broomhill Depot, Kilsyth Road, Kirkintilloch, Glasgow, G66 1QF, outlining their plans.
