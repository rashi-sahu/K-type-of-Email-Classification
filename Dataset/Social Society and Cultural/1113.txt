London terrorist attacks
Thursday 7 July 2005
(11 a.m. ) It had to happen, and now it‚Äôs happened.
Let‚Äôs realise now that this isn‚Äôt about Islam. Al Queda are murderous fuckers who worship nothing but death, and they bear as much resemblance to the muslims I know as the IRA do to the teachers at my daughter‚Äôs catholic school.
News reports still coming in. Colleagues in our London office are told not to close the windows and leave the building (secondary devices, I guess).
When the mess is cleared and
the dead people are counted, their loved ones consoled and their children comforted, let‚Äôs round up everyone who believes their religion requires or allows them to murder ‚Äì whether they be Jews, Christians, Moslems, Sikhs or Hindus ‚Äì and hang them all.
Civilisation can‚Äôt progress until that happens.
8p.m. An unbelievably small number dead. All friends and family accounted for. (My friends and family. In a couple of hundred homes in the UK tonight, there will be awful, unimaginable grief). Wierdly, I‚Äôm utterly stressed out, even though I no longer live in London.
Here‚Äôs a couple of great pieces of writing that shows why bombing London didn‚Äôt work for the Nazis, the IRA and it won‚Äôt work now:
The Mayor‚Äôs speech before leaving Singapore this afternoon:
I want to say one thing specifically to the world today. This was not a terrorist attack against the mighty and the powerful. It was not aimed at Presidents or Prime Ministers. It was aimed at ordinary, working-class Londoners, black and white, Muslim and Christian, Hindu and Jew, young and old. It was an indiscriminate attempt to slaughter, irrespective of any considerations for age, for class, for religion, or whatever
‚Ä¶ Nothing you do, however many of us you kill, will stop‚Ä¶ our city, where freedom is strong and where people can live in harmony with one another. Whatever you do, however many you kill, you will fail.
And A Letter To The Terrorists, From London:
We‚Äôre London, and we‚Äôve got our own way of doing things, and it doesn‚Äôt involve tossing bombs around where innocent people are going about their lives.
And that‚Äôs because we‚Äôre better than you. Everyone is better than you. Our city works. We rather like it. And we‚Äôre going to go about our lives. We‚Äôre going to take care of the lives you ruined. And then we‚Äôre going to work. And we‚Äôre going down the pub.
So you can pack up your bombs, put them in your arseholes, and get the fuck out of our city.
Added 7 July 2015: because someone got grumpy when I tweeted a link to this on the 10th anniversary, let me be clear: I don‚Äôt really believe in hanging people. I was angry, writing the above as it was happening.

What has amazed me is how slick the emergency services have been. It has been incredibly efficiently dealt with. You can tell we are a country that is used to terrorist attacks over the years. Honestly, what do they think will be achieved? The news said it was designed to create an element of fear. They obviously have no concept of the British if they think that will work. We are a country with an ingrained Blitz mentality not to mention 30 years of terrorist threat from the IRA and the like.

London explosions
My heart goes out to the people of London today. This is rather tragic.
I‚Äôm still waiting to see why this occurred, but if it is, indeed, simply in response to the G8 happening today. It‚Äôs horrible.

Glad to hear your dad‚Äôs OK ‚Äì I thought of him straight away when I heard about the attack on London. We suffered the Nazis in WWII and these arseholes are just Nazis of a different kind and like Blair (correctly, for a change) states, our way of life, in all its variety, for all its faults and its wonders, will still be here long after the extremists are gone and forgotten.
Peace to you all.
