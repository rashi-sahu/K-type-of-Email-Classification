Please Note:

MARK ALLEN - BRITCAR "DRIVER OF THE YEAR"
Mark's debut race season in cars could not have concluded any better.He has been awarded "Driver of The Year" by one of UK's most respected National Level race series.To be acknowledged like this is a huge achievement and highlights how far Mark and the team have come in one season.Not only that, but Mark now holds his FIA International Race Licence.
He is one of only three disabled British race drivers to do so and the only injured serviceman to hold this level of licence.
Our Chairman watched Mark race for over an hour in the recent 750 Motor Club Birkett 6 Hour Relay race on the Silverstone Grand Prix circuit in the pouring rain driving the Team Brit Golf.
He ran in 13th place OVERALL out of 70 teams.  Great driving worthy of BRITCAR "DRIVER OF THE YEAR".
If you are competing in an MSA motorsport event and have a disability you must have these "D" stickers on both sides of your kart or competition car.
Please refer to the Blue Book for more detailed information. These are now available on the MSA website in the Online Shop under MSA Publications - Product Code S-DIS  - www.msauk.org
