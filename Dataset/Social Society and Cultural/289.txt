Pleased to meet you.
Thanks for visiting our website!
We hope it gives you the opportunity to find out more about us . . .
All Saints Methodist Church is a friendly, diverse, active church where you will always find a  warm welcome.  We aim to cater for all ages and we offer different styles of worship at our services, held at 10.30am and 6.30pm.  We like to offer worship which includes challenging preaching and good music in a variety of styles.  Groups for children and young people meet during the 10.30 service, after which coffee is served.
We would love to meet you - why not come along on a Sunday or to one of our fellowship groups?
Christmas 2016
Find out more details about our Sunday programmes and  Pastoral groups.
The minister currently responsible for the Church is Rev. Ian Griffiths.  Here Ian shares a little about himself.
The church has level access, toilet facilities and a loop system in all the main rooms for those with impaired hearing.
Our monthly Prayer Diary can be used to help your devotions.
We seek to:
Share our faith in worship and study;
Reflect Christ's accepting love in friendship
and caring;
Help each other face any difficulties
and doubts;
Explore together what it means to be
God's people in today's world.
