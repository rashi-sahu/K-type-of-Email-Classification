What is a Logbook Loan?
A logbook loan, also known as a V5 loan, is a type of short term loan secured against
the borrower’s vehicle. Logbook loans are meant for borrowers who cannot qualify for
traditional loans because of bad credit, and thus don’t include credit checks in the
application process.
Logbook loans can be accessed quickly and easily. As long as you own a vehicle and
have a sufficient income to meet the repayments, you can qualify and get your money
almost instantly. It doesn’t even matter if you are self-employed, have had arrears,
CCJs, repossessions, or bankruptcy in the past. Even if your present credit doesn’t
qualify you for standard loans, our vast network of logbook loan lenders are more than
happy to provide the service that you need!

How it Works?
Here at Refugee Loans, we have made getting a logbook loan extremely easy! First,
you just have to submit your details through our online application form. We need to
know the make and model of your car, the amount you want to borrow, and how we can
reach you to give you your free quote.
We will then find a matching lender based on the information you provided. After this,
we will let you know that we’ve found one and give you a FREE quote. If you are happy,
we can then schedule a meeting between you and the lender so you can get your cash
immediately. Just bring along your car and the requirements, and if everything passed
the lender’s criteria, you can finalise the terms of the loan. You need to read the fine
print very carefully before signing the bill of sale and handing over your logbook. Once
you are sure with the terms, all you need to do is sign the credit agreement and get your
cash within that same day!
With a logbook loan, you don’t have to worry about your car being pawned. You only
have to bring it so it can be evaluated, but you can keep on driving it during the full
duration of the loan, as long as you pay the instalments on time.
What are the Requirements?
In case you are wondering, logbook loan requirements are very simple and easy to
meet! For you to become eligible, you just need to be over 18 years of age, a UK
resident, and a legal owner of a working vehicle. This vehicle should be insured and
must be out of financing, in order to qualify, although some lenders may consider those
which have very little balance left.
The paperwork is not complicated either. Since there are no credit checks, all you need
is to submit the following:
Proof of ID
Proof of Income- pay stubs and certification from your employer, bank
statements if you are self-employed
Proof of Address- at least 6 months of utility bills on the same residence. (It
helps if you are listed on the electoral roll with the same address.)
Vehicle registration or V5 document (logbook)
Ministry of Transport (MOT) Test- this should be done annually to ensure that
your vehicle has passed the road safety standards.
Proof of insurance- whatever happens to your car during the loan period, you
will be fully responsible, as you remain the legal keeper of it.
