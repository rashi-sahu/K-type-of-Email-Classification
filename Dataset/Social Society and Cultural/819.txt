Welcome to our website. The Street Society is a local organisation run by local people who care about the village of Street in Somerset.
The society was founded in 2001 by an enthusiastic group of people who recognised the need for a constituted body to take an interest in Street.
As the society has grown our role as a group of people who care about the future of Street has been recognised in many ways.
Whilst we seek to protect buildings of importance and record irreplaceable memories, we are not against change, hence out motto:
Protecting the past with an eye to the future
We have an active membership who can take advantage of our busy social programme, which includes monthly meetings with speakers on local topics and outings during the summer months.
Please use the tabs at the top of the page to explore our website and learn more about our society and the wonderful village of Street.
A number of items archived from our old website can be found on our documents page.
Details of our fellow societies in Glastonbury, Wells, Frome and Bridgwater can be found on our links page.
