Network of Oxford Women for Justice and Peace
Network of Oxford Women for Justice and Peace
The Network of Oxford Women (NOW) for Justice and Peace was set up in 2002
and is expanding fast. Founded at a time when, once again, the storm clouds
of war appeared to be gathering, it numbers in its ranks women from all
walks of life and a wide range of ages, professions, political views, religions
and ethnic groups. We have come together to oppose the use of military action
or threats of military action which terrorize the peoples of the world and
endanger peace. We take action by means of lobbying, letter-writing campaigns,
peaceful protests, organising public meetings and much more. Under the name
of Oxford Women in Black we organize silent peace vigils in the centre of
Oxford. We regularly take part in Oxford International Women's Festival,
contributing exhibitions and meetings. We are affiliated to Campaign Against
the Arms Trade (CAAT), joining their demonstrations at Arms Fairs and arms
manufacturers' Annual General Meetings.
