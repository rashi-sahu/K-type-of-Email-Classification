Welcome to the Royal Society of St. George
The Royal Society of St. George was founded in 1894 with the noble object of promoting "Englishness" and the English way of life.The Society quickly attracted the support of many distinguished public figures in England and throughout the British Empire. Its first Royal Patron was Queen Victoria; and the society has enjoyed the Patronage of every reigning monarch from that day to this.Our present sovereign, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, in 1963, bestowed a notable honour by granting the Society its own Royal Charter, a distinction of which its members are justifiably proud. The Society was further granted Arms in 1990.The objectives of The Society as laid down in its Royal Charter are:To foster the love of England and to strengthen England and the Commonwealth by spreading the knowledge of English history, traditions and ideals.To keep fresh the memory of those in all walks of life, who have served England or the Commonwealth in the past, to inspire leadership in the future.To combat all activities likely to undermine the strength of England or the Commonwealth.To further English interest everywhere to ensure that St. George's Day is properly celebrated and to provide focal points all the world over where English men and women may gather together.The Society is un-sectarian and independent of party politics. Membership is open to:All those who subscribe to the Objects of the Society; andAre born in England or wherever born being English men or English women or children or remoter issue of the same; orNot being of English descent nevertheless support the aims and
objectives of the Society.
