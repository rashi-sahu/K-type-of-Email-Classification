The Hereford Parachute Club was first established in 1963
by the 22nd SAS Regiment based in Hereford, Herefordshire, UK. This was at
the request from civilian residents in Hereford who wished to start sport
parachuting and the club was formed at  Shobdon Airfield, Hereford.
The club operated part-time until 1976 when it changed over
to full time operation and continued to do so until it finished operation’s
at Shobdon in 1990 and moved to Staverton Airfield in Gloucester and
operated a split Drop Zone.
The club again was now part time and continued until it
finally closed down in 1992. Over the many years that it operated, it
trained 1000’s of civilians to make their first jump and in its hay-day of
the early 1980’s was training 3000 person’s a year to parachute. Many of
these continued in the sport and went on further into, freefall, RW, CRW,
Base jumping and had careers such as photography in Skydiving.
