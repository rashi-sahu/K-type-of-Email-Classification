Analysis
By Peter HuntRoyal correspondent
In 2012, when the Queen passes yet another significant milestone, it'll be hard to escape the royals.
They'll be out in force across the UK and the 15 other countries where she is head of state.
Given her age, the Queen will be focusing on an extensive, well paced tour of these shores. Others will venture further afield.
The visit by Prince William and his wife to the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu will attract the headlines, but his father's tour is just as significant.
The Prince of Wales is going to Australia. Its prime minister is on record as saying her country should become a republic when Charles is on the throne.
Back in 2002, Prince Philip was asked which part of the Golden Jubilee he was looking forward to.
The Queen's husband is said to have replied, "the end".
The prince's overseas visit will be his first solo trip on behalf of the Queen. It might see Harry take the opportunity to stage a fundraising polo match on behalf of his Sentebale charity.The Duke of York will travel to India and the Princess Royal is set to visit Mozambique and Zambia.The Earl and Countess of Wessex will tour a number of Caribbean islands with an extra visit to Gibraltar.Other travelling royals include the Duke of Gloucester and the Duke of Kent. The former will head to the British Virgin Islands and Malta. And the latter is set to go to the Falkland Islands and Uganda.The host countries are likely to hold a range of events for the visiting royals, from official banquets and public celebrations to events that showcase the individual nations.'Enforced celebration'A Buckingham Palace spokesman said details and timings of the visits are "still under discussion with the host governments".The Queen will be 86 in April and Prince Philip, who will be 91 next year, has already publicly stated that he is reducing his workload.The pressure group Republic, which campaigns for a democratic alternative to the monarchy, has announced a series of demonstrations timed to co-ordinate with the official Jubilee celebrations. These include a protest on the afternoon of 3 June when a flotilla of up to a 1,000 boats, headed by the Queen and senior politicians, will travel along the Thames from Putney to Tower Bridge. Republic spokesperson Graham Smith said: "The Pageant goes to the heart of what's wrong with the monarchy. It's an enforced celebration of hereditary power, and all the problems that spring from it."
