Minimising our impact on resources. Maximising our role in the future.
Chilled food production in the UK is one of the world’s fastest-growing, most innovative and advanced food sectors. Currently worth around £11bn, it employs more than 60,000 people and each year puts 12,000+ products on shelves. CFA represents many of the UK’s biggest chilled food manufacturers.
Chilled food is our passion and we champion best practice across the industry and campaign actively on its behalf.
