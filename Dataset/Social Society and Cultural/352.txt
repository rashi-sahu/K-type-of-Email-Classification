Is there a science of charity, and would we want one?
A few months ago Joe Saxton, Driver of Ideas at nfpSynergy,
wrote a thought-provoking blog
challenging our sector’s enthusiasm for randomised control trials. Joe’s
article and the debate started in the comments, were fascinating and deserve a read.
But it prompted consideration of the question one step removed – before we look
at charities borrowing science’s tools, is it appropriate to compare charitable
and scientific worlds?
Randomised control trials are the current highest point of
evidence collection in the scientific method, a method whose genesis is
hundreds of years old and whose structure is supported by countless examples of
error, trial, error, improvement. When scientists operate, their experiments
rest not just on the shoulders of giants, but on the backs of a pyramid of
giants, trolls, charlatans and visionaries. Science learns from itself, from
its mistakes, around the globe and across the centuries.
The scientific method demands that results be replicable,
and expects an important experiment will be run by entirely different people
time and again. Science has operated for decades within the infrastructure of
the academic world, with a host of peer review journals and challenging
conventions, allowing distant practitioners to test the validity of claims and build
on success. Rivals and successors pore over datasets, read failed experiments
and negative results, perfect techniques. The world has far more STEM graduates
than experts in charitable operation or social policy research. The sector’s
main notable academic journal is that of the Wellcome Trust, Wellcome
Open Research. It is excellent, and it is, of course, a science journal.
This is not the only difference. Science and technology are
wedded more firmly to economic progress.
Shareholders, government, hospital directors
and the public take note of new drugs, stem cell breakthroughs, rumours of
groundbreaking green energy generators. Charity practitioners have nowhere near
this level of awareness – not because we are lazy or intellectually inferior,
but because we have no such support structure or history of sharing. Too often
in the charity sector, it is not just a case of one hand not knowing what the other
hand is doing: it is two fingers on the same hand each reaching out to grasp
the same object and still failing join up.
In the corporate world, certainly in the boardrooms of
pharmaceutical and tech companies, directors are inquisitive and acquisitive.
There are aware of all their competitors’ projects, what newcomers try, innovation
springing up in far-flung corners, blossoming SMEs. They are not only concerned
with keeping their own company afloat but with exploring expansion on the
frontier. They have teams of researchers comparing clusters of studies and
meta-analyses to scope opportunity. They are supported by both the academic
literature and by business media – the Financial
Times and rolling TV news. Likewise they have a worldwide network of business
schools, economics departments, management courses, decades of theories on
effective leadership and proactive governance.
There are of course a great number of collaboration efforts
in the charity sector, from the Good Exchange to the concept of “generous
leadership”, from joint initiatives between funder organisations and umbrella
bodies to local projects in the same town or village. One of Charity Futures’
ambitions is to compile a directory of these, listing free and paid resources
on charity academia, leadership and governance training, and emergency support.
Hopefully by signposting both collaborations and smaller ventures, even more
efficient partnerships can be forged. This could grow in utility by adding
neutral reviews and learning aids, so a bewildered new board member could
easily find out the different tools available to help her.
The other difference between science and voluntary worlds is
simply that a lot of charities do not operate in a manner with quantifiable
results. The goal of some is to enable a sport to be played, or to make a
group’s life more tolerable, hopefully enjoyable. There are sector activities
which suit social science measurements, like helping ex-prisoners reintegrate
or educating children, but a host of important charitable activities are little
to do with numbers. Has enough thought been devoted to testing an ethical
component, are quality-adjusted life years enough?
Trying to get a picture of impact by asking beneficiaries to
rate their experiences feels like missing the point, even if methodologies were
sound enough that they could be compared across location and type – which they
aren’t. Some of the largest management consultancies have been trying for years
to set out a standardised system to rate charity effectiveness and each model
sinks on its flaws. What the voluntary sector does brilliantly is use hard
science evidence in campaigning – against smoking near children for example –
and funds investigation of this type. But that does not contribute to a central
corpus on how charities themselves campaign.
The question of randomised control trials speaks to the
charity bubble’s current focus on, possibly even obsession with, transparency
and impact. You get the sense that many charity leaders believe that if we
could only display our accounts and give hard numbers on how many people we’re
helping, then the public and press would return to treating all charities as
angelic.
This is a limp hope. Few people have the time or inclination
to check the accounts and annual statements that charities painstakingly polished,
even fewer compare different possible donations in such detail. Even if they
do, they may not have the statistical grounding to make informed decisions, or
may leave with the wrong message, that all the charities they compared spend
too much on staffing, premises, IT and training. Certainly the sector should
not retreat on transparency, but nor should it slog on under the delusion that
once we reach a certain crystal-clear level, the public will fall in love.
Another difference charities may be more happy about. The
sector is far less regulated, and while the Charity Commission comes down hard
on some charities and may be seen as too bureaucratic, it pales in comparison
to pharmaceutical watchdogs. We have nothing that functions like the FDA/MHRA
testing and delaying new drugs for years. The Charity Commission does not
review every new project, grant or intervention that a charity plans, not even
very large experiments. Likewise most donors or funders would not be able to
block a charity functioning.
Try as we might we cannot create a ready-made academic
milieu for the voluntary sector, with the centuries of history, the
international network of journals, the expectation of challenge, refinement and
peer review. Multi-institutional multi-national collaborations do not spring up
overnight, but after years of relationship building, sharing techniques and
ethics, agreeing shared goals. But this is certainly a goal to have in mind:
through thought leadership, debate, seminars and working with the university
sector across disciplines, we must strive to introduce higher standards of
intellectual rigour and collective progress.

What would the National Trustees body do?
The
national survey of trustees conducted by the Charity Futures programme, Third
Sector, and nfpSynergy indicated strong support for a new national trustees
body. It follows that we should consider what such a body should actually do.
It should have clear aims and a distinct role not already covered by NCVO,
ACEVO, or the Association of Chairs. NCVO already has a governance department,
and ACEVO ran a governance review service: there is also the Governance Hub,
which produces the Code of Good Governance, which includes input from a whole
host of bodies.
Many
sector commentators already complain
that there are too many infrastructure bodies. Only with a very defined
purpose, funding structure, and place in the conversation would a trustees body
enjoy wides support. It is not jumping the gun to hypothesise what role such a
body should take. Fully 25% of our respondents thought that “a national body
supporting trustees” would be “very useful”, while another 36% thought it would
be “useful”.
The
question did not imagine what that support might consist of. Different
respondents likely interpreted it in different ways, projecting their own ideas
about infrastructure support onto the question. Such a body could do any number
of things, and the questions we had posed just prior to the one concerning
trustees bodies probably affected what respondents were thinking: they included
online training, better general training, trustee handbooks, and a trustee
e-newsletter or group. There was most supports, 82% positive responses, to the
generic idea of “Better training for trustees”, which doesn’t get us far.
How
would such training be delivered? Seminars, workshops, awaydays, off-line
courses? Would we have online video lecture series, mentorship programs, a
grand centre delivering cutting-edge governance literature? How much extra time
are trustees willing to devote to self-improvement? Would it be useful to have
more governance appraisal services, provided at an affordable rate? Would
funders and philanthropists have a more contributory role? Can charity boards
learn from the composition and practices of the private and public sectors? If
such a body did spring into being, how would it communicate with the public
what it was trying to do, and assess whether it bolstered third sector
leadership?
All
of the ideas above feel worthwhile but uninspiring. A few hours of tuition or a
quickly forgotten best practice document won’t have the impact we want. We need
a body that is seen, unlike the Charity Commission, as a mentor, not a monitor.
Perhaps there are many more innovations to come, or perhaps a carefully crafted
mixture of the options above is the best that can be done.
The
weighty challenge of governance demands joined-up big thinking. Marginal
improvements and small scale initiatives on their own won’t be enough. They
need to be set in this wider context, or small-fry thinking might become a
habit. It would be a disaster if the mentality that can only
justify minor interventions seeps into how foundations fund capacity. So the
answer may well lie outside the sector and certainly may be about big
philanthropy.
Trustee
concerns reflect our sector’s broader problem themes. There remains a tendency
to think too narrowly, e.g. contemplating governance simply as a question of
trustees and processes, failing to recognise that it is as much to do with
values and cultures – about how organisations are governed. That governing
covers executive and staff behaviour, not just board meetings. Governance
geeks, who just focus on the minutiae of process, are not only wrong; they are
dangerous. They risk driving out the passionate spirit which (alongside
professionalism) should be the sector’s hallmark.
These
are all issues that will need to be mulled over, indeed considered in great
detail, before anyone dives ahead. But this work can be really valuable if we arrive
at the right answer, or even as an answer that is mostly right. If we improve whole
sector governance by a small margin in back-office, unsexy ways, this would
translate into an imperceptible rise in quality of our whole sector’s
operations. Intervening upstream to avert another Kids Company, pre-empt an Age
UK or resolve a Terence Higgins Trust situation before it became an emergency:
that would be a great boon to the sector. More, helping each board that had
been merely muddling along, keeping their charity afloat, to really strive and
explore how to deliver the very best: that is worth spending time to work out.
This is why, without any doubt, Charity
Futures is now shaping up to be more than a two year journey - Woodford Investment
and I are in this longer term. But perhaps our most important contribution – at
least in the early years - will be to encourage others to join us in asking these
questions and looking for answers. We will become clearer with time, and this gives
us our best chance of delivering something meaningful.

Surveying the landscape: how do trustees feel?
For all the talk about charity
leadership and governance, we actually know very little about what board
volunteers think, what their training and backgrounds are, how they experience
their roles. Past attempts to reinforce the quality of those guiding our sector
have, in effect, been crafted half-blind. No wonder they have not always had
the hoped-for impact.
That is why, with nfpSynergy and Third Sector magazine, Charity Futures
has run the first comprehensive national trustees survey. We’ve been asking board
members how confident they are in their own groups’ skills, what challenges
they face, what support they receive and what are the best new ideas for
support they’ll actually use.  By using social
media, Third Sector’s readership and
ACEVO’s member list, we’ve achieved a good snapshot of charities large and
small, wealthy and modest, old and new.
Our results – together with choice
commentary from yours truly - will be out next Wednesday. The survey promises
to push the charity leadership conversation forwards and help us beef up the
back office.
And on 22 November, we are holding
a seminar with a range of sector experts on governance to help us digest these
results and look at next steps. This is all part of our efforts to discuss
widely with people and organisations to get their views on what an initiative
in governance might look like and how it might work (and indeed who might
fund it!)

Speaking truth to power, part II
As I have blogged just recently, it is often said that one of the core duties
of a charity is "to speak truth to power". It’s a phrase that originated
with the Quakers in the 18th century. The charge that they were
given to speak was threefold:
To those who hold high
places in our national life and bear the terrible responsibility of making
decisions for war or peace,
To the
people who are the final reservoir of power in this country and
whose values and expectations set the limits for those who exercise
authority,
To the idea of
Power itself, and its impact on life.
There is an obvious link between the work of the Church
and faith groups, and the work of charities in acting as the moral conscience
of the country and a thorn in the side of the powerful on behalf of the poor
and disenfranchised.
Of course this sometimes means we are both attacked by Governments and politicians
who argue we have no business playing politics. Former Archbishop Williams has
talked of the "illiteracy" of many politicians about our role and
this is but an example of that. If Christ turfed the money changers from the
Temple, would the Churches not be failing in their duty if they did not point
to the gap between the wealthiest in our society and the poorest? Is that not
true for charities?
It is sometimes argued that charities should "stick to the knitting".
In other words we should run soup kitchens or food banks for the poor but keep
our mouths shut about the causes of poverty. Fortunately neither the Church
nor charities will cease from these essential roles; both delivering services
to vulnerable people and the most damaged communities and holding those in
power to account.
Cardinal Nichols' trenchant criticism of the effects on
communities of welfare changes is a powerful example of the role Church leaders
can play and one to be applauded. The work of churches of all denominations and
other faiths is also a great example of community cohesion. Our Muslim
communities have a strong and abiding charitable tradition that mirrors that of
the Christian tradition. So the example being set by Archbishop Longley and
other faith groups in Birmingham offering the Muslim community solidarity is
another example of the role Churches can play in fostering stronger
communities.
Historically the link between faith and charity is strong and continues to be
binding. Charitable giving is one of the core duties of a Christian. From early
times the Church has encouraged and supported charities. Indeed many of the
earliest charities were run directly by the Church. One of ACEVO’s members, the
CEO of St. John's Hospital in Bath, is running an institution set up by
the monks and which, as they say, "through centuries of change (…) has
remained true to its purpose. Founded in the 12th century it is
still providing comfort in old age for those in need." Pope Innocent III in
1215 gave a letter of authorisation for the collection of alms, writing,
"with works of great mercy and for the sake of things eternal so sow on
earth what we should gather in heaven, The Lord returning it with increased
fruit."
Many of our great national charities have their roots deep
in the founding impetus of the Church; the children’s charities: Barnado’s, the
Children’s Society and Action for Children are cases in point. One of the
earliest hospices in the country, St Joseph’s in Hackney, was founded by the
Sisters of the Poor. The work of the great international NGOs such as Caritas,
Cafod and Christian Aid is sustained by the faithful and not simply through
giving but through active support for their campaigning role; to mention just
one example of that, "Make Poverty History".
So, at a time when the gap between the rich and the poor remains so large, we
need a renewed sense of purpose between the Churches and charities in our
common goal of giving voice to the voiceless. Similarly faith groups and
charities continue their work in providing care and welfare services for those
in need. Our role is growing as the State draws back from provision. Often this
is because of an increasing understanding of the role of citizen and community
focused charities, but also because the deep funding cuts demanded by austerity
have eaten significantly into the safety net of our welfare state. That role
will continue to grow and with it the much greater responsibilities that entailed.
And as Archbishop Longley reminded ACEVO members in his speech to us, poverty
encompasses so much more than just worldly goods. As he said, "poverty
includes isolation, loneliness, fear in one's environment, being deprived of
opportunities and lacking a voice". So we have that common purpose in
delivering basic support and care as well as speaking out.
When the translators of the King James Bible were examining the Latin texts for
the famous injunction of 1 Corinthians 13.13, there was much debate on the term
"caritas". Modern translations use "love" but the King
James scholars stuck to charity. Just a few years before they were deliberating,
there was also debate on the role of charities which led to the great 1601
Statute of Elizabeth on Charitable Uses. I like to think they eschewed the use
of "love" for charity as it is in charitable actions and approaches that we
demonstrate the love we must have for one another and for God.
"And there abideth faith, hope, charity; these three, but the greatest
of these is charity"

Speaking truth to power - or whispering?
Our sector is
supposed to pride itself on its ability to "speak truth to power" but
frankly at the moment you would be hard pressed to see many examples of it.
I was proud to be
part of the marvellous coalition of organisations that fought the Lobbying Act
and made such a change to it. We also worked closely with our colleagues to
fight the nonsense of the contract gagging clauses that still lurk around Rob Wilson's
in tray. But the reality is that the real threat to the sector is our own self-censorship.
In the big debates
of the moment you would need to look hard to find the charity leaders’ voice.
On Brexit for example we took a craven line in the referendum debate and now
are failing to effectively challenge the rise of xenophobia and hate crime.
There are honourable exceptions of course, and the organisations promoting the
cause of migrants and refugees is a great one, but by and large we have failed
to come together to promote the tolerance and inclusivity that our sector
espouses. Where for example was the voice of the sector denouncing the
appalling "foreigner employees" speech of Amber Rudd?
Then we come to
the horrendous crisis in our health and social care system. This strikes at the
heart of where our sector has traditionally been active. Many, many third
sector bodies are prominent in service delivery and advocacy. What is happening
with the care of the frail elderly in hospitals around the country is
scandalous. I have seen this at first hand with my father who has just spent
over two months in hospital, where I have seen the strains on the system.
Chris Hopson, who
speaks for NHS providers, has been a great example of someone prepared to tell
the truth publicly about the crisis. On Monday we had Jeremy Hunt on the radio
denying there is a problem and insisting that the planned cuts – so-called
efficiency savings – will go ahead. This is disastrous, and anyone who knows
what is happening in A&E or in the care system realises the need for more
resources.
But where are the
sector leaders in the media pointing out the crisis we face? Demanding action?
There is a curious silence when we need a voice. Sometimes leaders think you
work behind the scenes to get action and don't use the media. This is a wrong
approach.
The media is an essential ally and a great
negotiating tool. The media is not a nasty thing you wheel out when all else
has failed. Politicians respond when they feel there is public pressure
and concern.  Thinking you can make change through discussion and meetings
alone can be a flawed approach. A judicious use of media to give voice to
genuine concern, to articulate what beneficiaries are experiencing and to
demand action, is part of the process of getting action. Hopson has brilliantly
shown how this is done by exploiting media on behalf of his NHS provider
members whilst engaging seriously with them on solutions. Politicians and
ministers, and therefore officials, respond when there is a crisis and you are
there both demanding action publicly, and there to offer a solution. But they
also need to fear you. A charity leader uses media to extract change because
people trust us and listen to us and that is something many politicians don't
have.
But there is a second and perhaps more fundamental reason why we need the
media.  A charity is not there simply to deliver a service or act as an
agent of the State.  Our beneficiaries want someone to champion them and
articulate their concerns and demand change. They want to hear that. They want
to see it.  We are not simply there to work behind the scenes, necessary
though that is as well, but to speak truth to power in a way that reassures our
beneficiaries that we are on the case.
I'm
afraid Theresa May is deeply unengaged in the current crisis and will not until
she starts hearing us on Today or the
front page of the Mail or top of the
news. The NHS didn't do the pilots in A&E two years ago simply because I
presented Government with a neat paper. They did it because they feared the
damage a winter crisis could do. We have failed to capitalise on that.
Never fall for the trap governments set when they tell you won't get anywhere
if you go to the press. That secures compliance, not action.
I'm
reflecting what I am seeing in the media and also on 15 years of working with
politicians and getting results. When the Blair government wanted to make a
major policy impact on charities, Number 10 was able to ignore many sector leaders.
Those that were consulted – myself included – were those whose public backing
was vital to success, and whose public opposition in the press could have been
a serious thorn in the side. A charity leader needs to be in a position where they
are too dangerous to ignore, and they can provide answers to sort major problems.
Bob Kerslake,
former chief of the Home Civil Service, was quoted in Civil Society last week, pointing to the power of the sector and to
remember we are more powerful than politicians. He sums up my position
brilliantly:
"You have to
stand apart and have an independent voice, and in my experience in government
they respect those who stand up and challenge even if they don’t like it. The
worst thing you can be seen to do is cower in front of government because,
eventually, they will get you.”

Charity leadership and existential crisis
It’s no fun to think about the apocalypse, and even less fun
to think about slow-moving threats to our civilisations. Countering both is
nevertheless a key task, one that cannot forever be put off until tomorrow. It
may sound a grand claim, but charities are absolutely at the forefront of
unearthing and delivering solutions to these macro-scale events. For this
reason, their leadership really needs to be the same calibre, their governance
the same quality, as other sectors boast.
Take the old age crisis. In a few decades the ballooning
size of the over-70 population will have changed the landscape of the state,
with Britain, America, Japan and Germany especially affected. Pensions will not
go far enough to cover the elderly’s living costs, let alone inflated health
bills. To hope to maintain the standard of life to which Western citizens are
accustomed, there need to be structural changes in the tax, welfare, community
and health sectors. Public policy gurus are flummoxed.
Charity is already at the vanguard of innovation and best
practice in the different aspects of responding to this challenge. Local or
national, charities are exploring innovations promoting better care, whether
that be social or residential. Charities provide important services for the
elderly – medical help, mobility assistance, backing to personal independence,
and a supportive community. They coordinate volunteers to aid those in trouble,
help fight loneliness, and just bring a bit of human warmth.
Taking a wider view, our largest charities are crucial
drivers of medical research and technological advancement, whether that be
treatments, live-extension innovations or palliative breakthroughs. Charity
funding is behind possible solutions to protracted problems including stem
cells, genome mapping and nanotechnology.
There are further existential threats that come from
antibiotics losing effectiveness. Scientists hope to find new powerful
antibiotics in unexplored areas of the world such as rainforests, where
biodiversity is robust: third sector activism and funding protects these areas,
aids exploration, and seeks to conserve nature. A linked issue is food
shortage: if pollinators like bees, bats and insects suffer catastrophic
population decline through climate change, or global warming affects water and
soil quality, human crops would fail. Conservation efforts to protect wildlife
ecosystems and vulnerable areas across the world help stave off this
possibility.
Society can also be imperilled by intercommunity violence,
civil strife or terror. Work to help neighbours and those of different faiths
and ethnicities live happily and cooperate is a central task of many UK
charities.  Some of our most active voluntary
bodies strive to help refugees and migrants fit in through language assistance,
cultural integration and neighbourliness. This important work forms part of the
bedrock for our cohesive British landscape.
It’s clear then that charities play imperative roles in
acting to counter each of these major hazards, and lobbying states to take
effective action against them, and leading the way in researching best
practice. This underlines the need for excellent governance across the board.
Voluntary sector leaders and those responsible for charities are not minor
players, but chain links in society’s armour.
We need them to be
the best they can be.

Our ancient charities
One of the oldest charities in
the country is Sherburn House in County Durham.
It was founded in 1181 by a wise and forward thinking Bishop Pudsey of
Durham; he also gave them lands that still generate income for this great
charity today. It consists of a care home, almshouses and other facilities, as
well as a grants programme for the county. It even has its own Act of
Parliament under Elizabeth I, passed in 1585 (which came about as a result of
some past fraud, nothing new there then!)
I visited recently and had a
great day meeting with the CEO Pauline Bishop and key members of staff, as well
as looking around the site and meeting with the trustees. It was fascinating to
see the old chapel, still functioning as an integral part of the charity, and
they even have their own chaplain (a woman, so they may be ancient but they are
up to date theologically). There is an old plaque in the chapel marking the
tomb of a former chaplain who, the plaque proclaims, preached to King Edward VI.
They even have their own cemetery and a lovely woodland surrounds the site. I
was shown the Elizabethan chalice and flagons and patten from the 18th
century, which are part of the treasures of the charity.
The trustees are considering how
to update their governance arrangements and they very well understood the need
for good governance in the light of all the recent publicity. They have their
own history of problems and misdemeanours in the past and are clear they wish
to be a model of good practice so, for example they are looking at the number
of trustees they have, currently 16, terms of office, and the knotty issue of
trustees who are nominated by other organisations and therefore may not always
feel their responsibility lies with the charity rather than the nominating
body.  I've come across this issue before
and whilst the legal position is clear, i.e. you must put the charity interest
above that of your nominating body, this is often not the reality.
We often forget that our country
has a magnificent and proud history of charity, dating back to at least the 7th
century. Many of our old charities have their origins in the Church but have
reformed and moved with the times, but are still serving their beneficiaries in
the way that Bishop Pudsey envisaged some 900 years ago.
We should celebrate our great
history. At some stage in my life I intend to write a history of charity. There
is nothing around since the 60s accounts written by Harvard professors. We need
a proper history. I'm collecting the material gradually and have even spent a
month in archives in the Bodleian in Oxford and at Lambeth Palace. It's a
project for my retirement, though that is years off I'm afraid.
