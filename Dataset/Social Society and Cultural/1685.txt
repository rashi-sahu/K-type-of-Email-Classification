Five Rivers Children’s Services
Turning Children’s Lives Around, High Impact, Sector Leading Services
Formed in 1989, we provide therapeutically informed practice. A place where children and young people can recover from experiences of abuse, neglect, family breakdown and trauma.  Our Mission is to make a positive and lasting difference through first rate care, ensuring that every vulnerable child and young person can grown, flourish, fulfil their potential and to find the right placement for them, first time.
Over the past 27 years we have developed our  Fundamental’ services, each of which are principle-based and remain embedded within our complete range of  ‘High-Impact Sector Leading Children’s Services’.  We treat each other with Respect, Honesty and Integrity and expect this to be reflected in our relationships with children, their families, colleagues and external agencies.
We are a leading independent, Social Enterprise that works with ‘Looked-after Children’ who are in need of specialist placements  throughout England and Ireland.  Being a Social Enterprise means that we care passionately about creating positive social impacts.
We are child-centred, adaptable and innovative in how our services are designed.  We demonstrate resilience, value for money and ethical commitment becoming the partner of choice for local authorities.
At Five Rivers we promote a strong, pragmatic philosophy, shared by all of our professional and experienced staff that each child or young person is an individual in their own right, with their own unique reactions to trauma.
We strive to ensure that the children and young people we work alongside have access to the right programmes to enhance the delivery of psychological well-being. Thereby offering a needs-led placement programme with endless choices during the care planning process.
Our aim is to offer children, staff and foster carers high-impact sector leading support, underpinned by a robust practice model. Helping and guiding them to work through their challenges and difficulties across our  Foster Care, Residential Children’s Homes  Crisis Intervention Assessment and Therapy and Specialist Schools. Children in our care at Five Rivers are supported and guided by our experienced, expert therapeutic practitioners.
Our unique integrated approach over the last 27 years has enabled us to cement ourselves at the forefront of a sensitive sector and remain an independent Social Enterprise.
We have a unique range of services which ensures Five Rivers provides the right placement first time.  We want to help all children in care experience the care and support a parent would give.
