LGBT History Month is celebrated throughout February each year.
Each year LGBT History Month celebrates a different aspect of LGBT life.
In 2012 we celebrated achievements in Sport, so we created a
Timeline of UK LGBT Sport;
in 2013, Science: Timeline of UK LGBT Science;
2014, Music: Timeline of UK LGBT Music;
2016, Religion, Belief and Philosophy: Timeline
of UK Religion, Belief and Philosophy.
