Hi. My name is Yolanda Shamash. I am a teenage girl with opinions and they're not all about boys!
As you can see, I'm pretty much your standard British teenage girl. However, when I'm not doing 'standard teenage girl' things like going out with friends or worrying about my future student debt, you can usually find me getting involved in a variety of projects. Usually things like local politics, musical productions and journalism outside of Not All About Boys. I've created this website to get other people involved and to keep myself writing more often!I've been blogging now for about three years, and I usually write both serious political pieces and more lighthearted opinion pieces. The link to check out my blog is at the top bar- it's the second tab, entitled 'The Blog'. I've also got a section for my non-blog witterings, in case you're interested, in which I'll be posting stories, poems, etc-  entitled 'My Other Literature'!You can email me at notallaboutboys@hotmail.co.uk- any comments would be greatly appreciated.And check out www.yolandashamash.com if you'd like to know more about me and my achievements (rather than my blogs, which are all on this site). Thanks for reading!Not All About Boys Newsflashes!Check out my latest (very) short story, called Useless.
New short story!
Or something a little more lighthearted...
