Hi..I haven't logged on in years (literally) so i wanted to say hi to all my old friends and no to all the new ones I haven't met.
I have two boys. Eldest has a diagnosis of asd and we are currently having a screening for dyspraxia.
I've been out of touch for quite a while as have had 3 years of fighting to get my son into the right educational setting. He has been in now for a year and it's going well. X

Dyscalculia
Sun 12 Feb 2017 5:48pm
Topics: Other autism issues
I have a diagnosis of autism, but have not been assessed for dyscalculia, although I know I have it because I've always struggled with numbers and have no maths qualifications as a result (it's beyond just having a weakness in this area - I have a severe deficit that was picked up on in primary school, and was assessed, but no official diagnosis was given - dyscalculia was not  formally named until very recently).

This research study is being shared a lot on social media right now so I thought I'd post it here: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-26354217

Music as a Special Interest
Thu 17 Apr 2014 3:04pm
Topics: Off Topic
Sorry if I'm being blind, but I can't find a music thread (and even if there is one, I intend this to be a bit more specific).Music is hugely important for me, and has been a particular interest of mine since I was a teenager.  As you'd expect from an autistic special interest, I'm very specific about what I'm into, and am quite happy to identify as a music nerd.  My own particular interest is Heavy Metal, specifically classic Heavy Metal (famous acts like Iron...
