Welcome to the Urban Honey Collective the web site for people who
love honey from their local area.
The collective is the web site that allows the consumer to find a
beekeeper in their local area.
All you need to do is find your area on the honey map. You will find any
listed beekeepers or beekeeping groups in your area with their contact
details.
All you need to do is contact the beekeeper and find out if they have
any honey available.
