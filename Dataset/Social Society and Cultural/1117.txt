#MakeTime2Listen
Children’s Grief Awareness Week ran from November 17th to 23rd, and it’s important to know why this matters. 1 in 29 school age children have lost a parent or sibling, and that’s a pretty big number. When I lost my Dad I didn’t talk about it for years, especially to my family.

Our wonderful long-term YAG member Paddy O'Hare has made a touching video on his experience with bereavement. He was brave enough to tell his personal story on the loss of his Dad, and share it with the world to help other young people. Read what Patrick has to say about making the video and its impact for young people.
