There are 200,000 grandparents and family carers raising up to 300,000 children
Many kinship carers give up work & end up in poverty. 7 in 10 are stressed, depressed or isolated
We think kinship carers should be treated like adopters with leave entitlements and more support
Grandparents Plus is the national charity which champions the vital role of grandparents and the wider family in children’s lives
– especially when they take on the caring role in difficult family circumstances. We do this because we want to make children’s lives better.
We want to say a very big thank you to players of People’s Postcode Lottery who have awarded us £250,000 towards our work. This funding will allow us to reach more families and help them get the support they need.
