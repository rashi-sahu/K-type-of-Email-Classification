Quaker Homeless Action
Quaker Homeless Action (QHA) is a national charity run primarily by volunteers. QHA is a small and
flexible organization that focuses on projects that are not funded by other organisations. Our projects include The Quaker Christmas Shelter and The Quaker Mobile Library.  We are always
keen to hear from f/Friends with suggestions for other areas of work we could support - see our Affiliate Projects page for more information about this.
The majority of funding for the work of Quaker Homeless Action
comes from donations from Quakers. The charity is one example of Quaker ‘hands-on’ practical help in Britain today, and is run by a volunteer Council of Trustees
QHA's vision is for a society where homeless, marginalised and excluded people are empowered and supported to break out
of exclusion, poverty, and isolation to experience life in all its fullness.
