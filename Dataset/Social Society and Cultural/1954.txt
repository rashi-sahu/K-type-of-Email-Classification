Be part of PAPYRUS
Suicide is the biggest killer of young people - male and female - under 35 in the UK. Many thousands more attempt or contemplate suicide,
harm themselves or suffer alone, afraid to speak openly about how they are feeling.
We are the national charity for the prevention of young suicide. We draw from the experience of many who have been touched personally by young suicide across the UK and speak on their behalf in our campaigns and in our work.
We need more people who share our aims to join us to strengthen our voice - together we can save young lives.
I'm an existing member and i'd like to renew my membership for 2016-2017
I'd like to become a member of PAPYRUS for 2016-2017
We encourage all of our supporters to become members to help us to campaign and demonstrate the strength of our voice as a national charity. We will prompt you to renew your membership commitment each year.
Members receive our e-News and mailed Newsletter and are eligible to vote at our annual AGM. There is no charge for being a member, although we always welcome a financial contribution to our life-saving
work if you are able. Donate here.
I'd like to receive the PAPYRUS e-News and mailed Newsletter but don't want to be member
