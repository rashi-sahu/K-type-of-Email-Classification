Sir Ralph Kohn 1927-2016
We were saddened to hear in November of the passing
of Sir Ralph Kohn, the eminent pharmacologist, musician and
philanthropist. Sir Ralph was a generous friend of the charity; a
regular at the London Chess Classic dinner who held his own in simuls
against Korchnoi, Speelman and others.
Before his
family were
driven out
by the
Nazis, on a
boat that
came under
fire from a
German
warplane,
Sir Ralph
lived in
Amsterdam as
a child and
told me how
he was taken
to watch
Alekhine
play.
He used to enjoy solving the Times chess puzzle every day
and I was very touched at his funeral to hear in the orations so much about
his love of chess.
The family have kindly shared the tribute from the former
Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks who was a close friend of Sir Ralph that was read
out at the funeral.
Ralph Kohn was one of the most remarkably multifaceted
individuals I have ever met. He excelled in at least four domains: Medical
research, business, music and philanthropy. He was a man of enormous soul
with a passion for life, and for enhancing the lives of others.
The knighthood he received from Her Majesty the Queen
was richly deserved and conferred honour on our community and of the Jewish
values by which he lived. Future generations will look on his life's
achievements and wonder how one individual was able to achieve so much in so
many areas of life. We will cherish and be inspired by his memory.
CSC will always be grateful for his support.

Teaching Chess to the Older Person
by
CSC Tutor Jon Lloyd
Jon Lloyd is a CSC tutor
in Berkshire and Surrey who has been active
in the voluntary sector for vulnerable
adults over the last 15 years and recognised
the potential value of the Chess in Schools
program for use in the wider adult
community.
In 2015 Jon successfully
approached CSC with a proposal for teaching
chess to older people in order to help
maintain or improve cognitive functions
[thinking skills] and socialisation.

Queensbridge
Champions again!
Queensbridge Primary School coached by
CSC Tutor Lee Bullock equalled the record score ever
achieved at the London Chess Classic Schools events this
year with 73/75!
Several players scored five wins and
15/15 and there were lots of individual medals! Players
score three for a win, two for a draw and one for playing
the game.
Last year Queensbridge finished 3rd in
the schools event, only losing out to North West London
Jewish Day School, another school Lee teaches in. Two years
ago Queensbridge were joint first with William Patten,
another school with a fine chess pedigree.
A funny story from the day was
Queensbridge’s Hector playing on the stage in the auditorium
during the Chris and Danny Show and holding up his captured
pieces as the electronic demo boards were not working.
Most importantly all the children had a
great day and love their chess. A big mention also has to go
to Julian Erwin who has been so supportive of chess at
Queensbridge.

on a strong track record in curricular enrichment,
with a view to offering as broad a range of
opportunities to our children as we can. Chess fits
very well into this programme."

Seminar on the Didactics of
Strategy Games
02.9.16
-
There is considerable international interest in
using strategy games to help
to develop children’s
thinking skills. A seminar
in Cambridge on 1st October
2016 brings together experts
at teaching strategy games
including chess, go and
backgammon in order to share
knowledge and exchange
ideas.
Through a mix of talks
and workshops, the seminar
will explore why we teach
games, the use of games in
education, the relative
strengths of different games
and insights into how to
teach the various games.
Places are very limited.
The event is organised by
Chess+, a specialist games
education consultancy.

Chess wins out at first CSC
Haringey Schools tournament
July 2016
Seven Sisters Primary
School in Tottenham
hosted the first CSC
Haringey Schools Chess
Tournament.
Four local schools -
Chestnuts, Coldfall,
Earlsmead and Seven
Sisters - took part
involving almost 50
children.
The tournament
provided an opportunity
to children who learnt
to play chess through
CSC to play against
children in other
schools. So winning
games was less important
than just the experience
of playing chess in a
place different to their
classroom or the school
chess club. And
hopefully having a fab
time.
Well done to all the
children who took
part. They played
their matches in a
friendly manner and
showed great
sportsmanship
regardless of their
result.
Some of the children
did exceptionally
well. Isabelle
Mok from
Coldfall had the
best score (14 out
of 15) of all the
children taking
part. She was the
overall winner. An
amazing feat.
There were a
number of
children who
came close to
Isabelle with
scores of 12/15
and 13/15. They
were each
awarded Silver
and Gold medals
in recognition
of their
achievement.
Finally, a huge
thank you to
Seven Sisters
Primary for
hosting the
event. Many
thanks also to
the staff and
parents of the
other schools
taking part for
getting the
children to the
tournament and
back home at the
end.

Academic Year Extension
19.5.16 -
As a result of increased charitable
giving to CSC, we are pleased to be able
to extend our core programme to 35 weeks
for this academic year at no additional
cost. Participating schools who wish to
take advantage of this should contact
their CSC tutor.
The charity is encouraged that schools
are already signing up for the
additional weeks: "We've been
delighted with the chess this year and
are pleased that we are able to continue
for another few weeks" (Cumnor
Primary School, Oxford).
Editor of the Independent
and Independent online Amol
Rajan has written an article
in support of chess in
school which appeared in the
Evening Standard on 17th
March. We wholeheartedly
agree with his conclusions!
17 March 2016
Amol Rajan: Chess - the
cheap, easy solution for our
underperforming schools
Grand master: Reigning world chess champion
Magnus Carlsen
George
Osborne announced in
yesterday’s Budget that £1.5
billion would be made
available to extend the
hours of British state
schools. This is a
marvellous and long-overdue
development and I have an
idea to make it even better,
while neutralising the
immediate and predictable
criticism levelled at the
Chancellor.
It should
be admitted that a causal
link between school hours
and educational performance
is not easy to prove. The
Finns have outstanding
performance levels but
shorter days than even us
lazybone Brits, though they
have exceptionally
well-qualified and trained
teachers (usually seen as
the best determinant of
outcomes).
Then
again, Asian countries such
as India and Singapore
generally have longer school
days than us, and much
better performance.

After-school clubs 'boost
poorer pupils' results'
17 March 2016 | By Katherine Sellgren Education
reporter
After-school clubs were shown to close the gap
between rich
and poor
Research
from the Centre for
Longitudinal Studies at UCL
has found that participation
in after-school activities
can boost the academic
performance and social
skills of disadvantaged
children.
Attendance at after-school
clubs led to Key Stage 2
results significantly better
than expected among children
from disadvantaged
backgrounds, suggesting that
they may help bridge the
attainment gap to other
children, the authors
concluded.

a tournament for primary and elementary schools and is open
to every UK primary school, not just those in the CSC
programme. Teams consist of 5 players born after 31st

matches can be played either face-to-face or online via the
Yes2Chess server.
The Yes2Chess mentoring scheme will also continue
with Barclaycard employees donating their time and expertise to chess in
school projects in London, Northamptonshire, Liverpool and Teesside,
where employees will help with chess lessons, both after school and in
lesson time.
Last year 443 Barclaycard employees gave the equivalent of
over two working years to such projects across 8 countries as Yes2Chess
impacted over 40,000 children.

First birthday reception for the charity
Chess in Schools and Communities
18 October 2011
Rachel Reeves MP, Member of Parliament for Leeds West,
hosted our first birthday reception in the Jubilee Room
at Westminster on Tuesday. A huge thank you to Rachel
who recently
visited
one of our schools in her constituency to give a
simultaneous display. Despite not having played
competitively for many years, she remains a very good
player and even Garry was impressed.
Children from Teesside, Leeds, Manchester, Liverpool,
Swansea, Cardiff, Bristol, Barnet, Hackney, Newham and
Hammersmith and Fulham were accompanied by their
teachers and parents. Every child got the chance to take
on Nigel Short in a simultaneous display. Rachel spoke
about how learning chess at an early age had helped her.
CSC are also grateful to the 13th World Champion Garry
Kasparov who came to London and spoke at the event as
well as making many media appearances. Thanks also to
Nigel Short who played the children and a few MPs
without losing a game!
Your browser does not support inline frames or is currently configured not to display inline frames.
Grandmaster Jonathan Rowson and our Field Worker England
international Sabrina Chevannes, also made some moves.
There was an outstanding performance from Matteo Walls
of William Patten School in Hackney who nearly drew. I
played a few moves and came to his board to find the
position completely equal after about 30 moves – well
done!
Rachel’s colleagues in the Labour Shadow Cabinet; Angela
and Maria Eagle also attended the event. They, like
Rachel, were strong junior players but in my home city
of Liverpool.
