Documentary about Altruistic Living Organ Donation – Fiona Hill BBC Producer

UK – Would you like to take part in a documentary? I was contacted by Fiona Hill a producer for the BBC Science Unit. A documentary is being made about altruistic donation and in particular looking for recipients via social media such as Facebook.
This is the message she has asked me to post.
All communication is confidential and contacting Fiona by no way commits you to taking part in the documentary.
Fiona is a lovely lady, very easy to communicate with and she looks forward to receiving emails from anyone who might be interested or would like to know more.
Fiona Hill a producer for the BBC Science Unit is making a documentary about altruistic living organ donation for BBC Radio 4 and she would love to hear from you.
Talking to her doesn’t mean you have to be in the programme, but she really wants to hear from those of you who have used social media (or are planning now to launch a campaign) to appeal for an organ donor.
She would also very much like to talk to people who have in the past donated an organ to a complete stranger, inspired by appeals they have seen on social media, or perhaps somebody who is currently going through the process of offering to donate an organ to somebody in need.
You could contact Fiona by e mail at
fiona.hill@bbc.co.uk and she is very happy if you would like the conversation to remain confidential.

Wales organ donations rise in year after consent law
The Welsh Government says more lives have been saved since Wales became the first country in the UK to introduced a deemed consent system.
Adults are regarded as having allowed organ donation unless they have opted out.
In the last year, there have been 160 organs transplanted and 39 were through deemed consent.

Woman with 100-year-old kidney from mum ‘still going strong’

A woman with a 100-year-old kidney has credited its longevity on coming from “good stock”. She would know – it came from her mother.
Sue Westhead was 25 when she was diagnosed with kidney disease in 1973.
When told a transplant was her only chance of survival, her mother Ann Metcalfe, then aged 57, donated her kidney to her daughter.
Now Sue, 68, and her kidney are “still going strong”, defying medical predictions over the organ’s lifespan.

Are you an altruistic donor or recipient in Scotland?
March 9th, 2016 |
Author: Diane |
Read/Add Comments »
A small, friendly group of people, in Scotland, have come together to help promote non-directed (altruistic) kidney donation.
Colin posted this as a comment on one of my posts on this website.
Following an initial meeting in Edinburgh with Susan and Pam, we had another meeting last night with donors Chris, Kate and John, and recipient Gus, and as a result have formed an informal group to raise public awareness of altruistic kidney donation in Scotland. We are mostly based in the east, but are happy to include any Scots that wish to join us, and help expand our horizons. We have plans to make presentations to small groups/clubs such as Rotary and WI, but in time we hope to involve the press and broadcast media. The tenth anniversary in September of the change in the law may prove a useful hook for media coverage. The media being what they are, it would be useful to have a well-known personality (either donor or recipient) on our team.
Although we have no official affiliation, we will probably try to work with giveakidney.org, and will also promote your website. Incidentally, that’s a great piece about your donation on their website.
We’re just starting, and have a lot to learn, but our long term aim is to match the number of Scottish donors to the number on the waiting list – quite a challenge! We realise, incidentally, that kidneys are matched throughout the UK, not specifically in one area; it’s just a convenient way of setting a target.
We’d like your help in encouraging other Scots donors (and recipients) to join us. Everyone can help in their own way, be it in giving talks to small groups, being available for one-to-one meetings, helping with distribution of literature, or advising on promotions. We’re a very friendly group, and all of us have found it really enjoyable being able to share our experiences with each other. From there it’s a small step to sharing with others.
Take care,
Colin.
If you are interested in joining them, or want further information, please contact Colin on
haggis{at}acme-properties.co.uk
please replace the {at} with @ …… putting the email in full would attract the spammers unfortunately.

Have you considered donating a kidney?
November 25th, 2015 |
Author: Diane |
6 Comments »
I donated a kidney to someone I did not know. All I knew was that there were thousands of people out there in need a new kidney as their health was really suffering. I had two kidneys – one of them was a spare. Why wait until I am dead, in the hope my organs would still be viable. I wanted to make sure at least one person benefited now.
It is not just the recipient who benefits from a kidney transplant. It is their whole family! What must it be like to be the spouse, parent, child, best friend etc of someone who you know, just watching them day after day ….. praying they get the life saving phone call to say there is a kidney available.
What must it be like for the person knowing they cannot have as much water as needed when thirsty – because their kidneys cannot process it. Even foods with liquid have to be monitored – fruit, vegetables etc. I am no expert on what is required to keep alive when on dialysis. I just know, having spoken to some people who are – it reduced me to tears. I said to one person “I don’t think I could live the life you live, year after year, with such limitations on what you can eat/drink. Spending three days a week travelling/hooked up to dialysis, week after week, year after year.  The fact you cannot stray too far away in case that life saving phone call comes”. I felt humbled, and ashamed, when he said “you have no choice – you either want to live or you don’t”!
People ask – why should I donate when the family are not! Very simply, just because they have family, does not mean the family are a match. It is more than just being a compatible blood group. Also a lot of people needing a new kidney is because they have a hereditary illness that causes the kidneys to fail. So family members also can have this. Many reasons why someone, other than family, needs to be the donor.
A question I am sometimes asked is why does someone need a kidney when they have dialysis to replace the kidney?
I have to say I was so guilty of that assumption pre donation!! You see pictures in the media of people on dialysis, and to be honest, so often the person looks very healthy as though dialysis is the perfect solution.  I still feel so guilty when I realise how wrong I was. Dialysis is a life support machine. No more, no less. It helps keep people alive until they can get a new kidney. It does NOT replace a kidney, far from it.
So if the thought ever crosses your mind about donating a kidney to someone – anyone – JUST DO IT! It will also be the most rewarding experience you could have.
Read the links on the left of this page under “Become a Donor” to find out what it is like and what the process is. Any questions, just comment on this post or send me a message via the Contact Page – link at top of this page.
I take a personal interest in anyone who wishes to donate and will stay in contact with them, and support them throughout the whole process.
My only regret about donating, is that I have no spare kidneys left to donate. If I had, I would – in a heart beat. I just pray when my time comes to meet my Maker – that my remaining organs are viable and can go to helping other people.
Please sign the organ donor register.
Please consider donating a kidney to someone during your lifetime. Don’t think your age will be against you – people in their 80’s have donated.
To all reading this who are waiting for an organ transplant, or know someone who is – stay strong! Your time will come.

Does paying kidney donors – get rid of the waiting list?
September 20th, 2015 |
Author: Diane |
Read/Add Comments »
I find it interesting whenever the subject of paying donors for their kidney – the subject of Iran comes up. Iran is the only country where they legally pay their citizens to donate a kidney to another Iranian citizen. News reports praise their scheme saying they do not have any waiting lists for kidney transplants. BUT – which media reports are to be believed. Here are two links re the Iranian kidney donation system. Are these to be believed? Who knows, I have not had the time to investigate to decide. I know at the very bottom of this link it shows the “official” waiting list for transplants in Iran.
I have also read reports that it is still only the rich who benefit. The poor living in outlaying villages who have no money are not even on the waiting lists as they cannot afford to even travel to the hospitals, or if they can no way can they afford the required medication needed after a transplant ……
There are many myths surrounding the Iranian system – which to believe and which not – I am going to try and find out. So if you hear/read of anyone saying paying donors to give a kidney gets rid of waiting lists – look at Iran – then send them to this link.
I am not after debating whether donors should be paid or not, that is an entirely different post altogether. This is about the possibility of media/people implying tht paying donor for their kidneys solves the kidney waiting list.
The case for Iran – to me – is far from proven. I am not saying the information o the link below is 100% correct. This is just it. Which media information we read is correct? I am hoping to find out.
Please read this link: Incentives, kidney donation, and the myth of the Iranian waiting list

Being a living kidney donor is not for everyone. Hopefully my website will show people what being a live donor is like. After reading the links down the left under “Become a Donor” it will inspire some people to want to be a living donor. If that is the case I would love to hear from you 🙂
BUT – there is nothing stopping most people signing up to the organ donor register. It DOES make a difference. Read this story about a lovely lady who received a kidney when she was 19 years old. 31 years later – yes 31 years – that same kidney is working well.
This is truly an inspiring story

UK research project re altruistic kidney donation
April 26th, 2015 |
Author: Diane |
Read/Add Comments »
This is a research project for the United Kingdom only
Many people who contact hospitals because they are interested in donating a kidney altruistically (i.e. to a person that they do not know) do not end up completing their donation.
The University of Plymouth is undertaking research, led by Clinical Psychologist Dr Alexis Clarke, aiming for a better understanding as to why this is, by focusing on the influence of family and friends.
They are looking for altruistic donors or potential kidney donors, and those who have decided not to proceed, to participate in an interview-based study. They would also like to speak with any family members or friends who had a significant influence over their decision to donate or withdraw.
They hope the results will have a direct impact on the assessment and care of future altruistic donors. They would like to produce written information that targets family members’ concerns directly.
The interviews will take around one hour, after which interviewees will be sent a summary to comment upon. Participation is entirely voluntary.
This project is being funded by the British Renal Society and British Kidney Patients Association and fully supported by Give a Kidney.
Please contact Alexis Clarke, Clinical Psychologist for more information, on alexis.clarke@plymouth.ac.uk or by telephone 07940729500. Alternatively you can write to University of Plymouth, Faculty of Health and Human Sciences, Rolle Building, Drake Circus, Plymouth, Devon, Pl4 8AA.
Please help to support this important project.

Let’s hope we continue to see this increase in donors each year.

Organ Donation – Educate our Children – They are our Future
February 24th, 2015 |
Author: Diane |

How can we encourage more organ donors.
I have said for a long while now, whether on the subject of politics, carbon emissions, rain forest protection, birth control, fair to farmers prices, organ donation ……. no matter what the subject, the FUTURE of our whole world – is in the hands of the children of TODAY and tomorrow and the day after that.
What we teach our children today will have a huge bearing on the future. Somewhere out there, is a 10 year old, 11 year old, 2 month old etc etc who one day will be our Prime Minister, Minister of Health, of Transport – of whatever – our teachers, doctors, solicitors; our general work force – our future!  The same applies to any country.
We are the guardians of our children. It is up to us as parents, grand parents, aunts, uncles, teachers, politicians … as adults – to educate our children in all aspects of what will benefit in the long term as well as short term.
Organ donation numbers may be low now … but …. if we EDUCATE our children better so they grow up knowing the importance of organ donation, including living donation, and grow up with no fear, no myths – but the true facts – we will gradually see the organ donation numbers rise as those children not only grow up, but they EDUCATE their parents and relatives.
It is amazing how well children can be teachers themselves. They are the very people who can educate adults in this subject, much better than we can at times.
It saddens me, that governments do so little to plan for the future. Every school should have a compulsory subject to educate children on what really matters in this world – and organ donation REALLY matters.
In 2011 I was invited by St. Gregory’s Catholic College in the City of Bath to talk to the classes organ donation – in particular my own donation. One of the members of staff who accompanied me told me afterwards they had never seen the classes so enthralled or attentive. They really were interested in the subject. They had many, very sensible and interesting questions to ask me. It really opened their minds to organ donation.
Why cannot this be a standard lesson in schools.
Sorry for this long post, but I feel so passionate about educating our children re organ donation, including live organ donation, and it frustrates me so much that not much is being done about it.
But perhaps all you can help. Anyone with any knowledge of organ donation, whether you have donated; are waiting for a transplant; etc etc …. see if you can give a talk to your childs class at school. Maybe get a few people together who can talk from all sides .. donor, recipient, family member of ……
Our children today – are the adults of our future. The leaders of our future. They need to be shown now – what is really important.

Play re kidney donation in USA
January 15th, 2015 |
Author: Diane |
Read/Add Comments »
Mainly aimed at my USA readers, anyone living near to the Arden Theatre in Philadelphia, PA then this is for you.
Playwright Michael Hollinger has produced a play on the comic aspects of a kidney transplant.
Sometimes it takes comedy to get the message across. Now, of course I have not seen this production but am assuming it will be well received and word will spread.
Now we just need someone in the UK to produce a similar play for the West End and to travel around 🙂 …….
If anyone gets to see this play, would love you to report back on your views and whether it has had any positive impact re kidney transplant/donation etc.
Under the Skin, which will begin previews Thursday and run through March 15 at the Arden Theatre, Philadelphia (USA) –  is the result of Hollinger’s deep dive into the world of organ donation – a months-long process of interviewing local donors and recipients and examining the fraught interactions that arise when a person is asked to hand over a chunk of her own precious tissue.
You can read more here – Under the Skin by Michael Hollinger
Come on! Any UK playwrights out there want to do something similar over here? …. don’t be shy 🙂

Dedicated Transplant Teams

I donated one of my kidneys to a stranger at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford.
The lead Living Donor Co-Ordinator is a wonderful lady called Sandra Dix. One word comes to mind when describing her and the whole team – AMAZING.
Here is a news article on Sandra and her dedication.  She is not alone in her dedication, as transplant teams across the country also have very dedicated teams looking after donors/recipients. Lead Nurse Sandra Dix
Please consider giving the “gift of life” and donating a kidney to someone. Either someone you know, or a stranger.  It is a gift you will never regret giving. I just wish I could give that gift again. Well actually hopefully I can after my death. My remaining kidney could go on to save someone. So it is equally important to sign the organ donor register.  Make that a gift this Xmas …. sign the register 🙂 – you can select which organs you would like to donate.

Are you considering donating a kidney?
October 17th, 2014 |

Are you considering donating a kidney either to someone you know or to a stranger?
If so you need to read these pages. You can ask your hospital all the questions you want. But unless the person you are speaking to has actually donated a kidney themselves – they will not know the answers to some of the questions.
Here on Living Kidney Donation website,  you will read a full account of what it is like being a kidney donor.
From the very first appointment “kidney donor evaluation begins” right through every stage of the evaluation, including the operation itself and recovery in the hospital and then recovery at home.
Please also read any comments made on posts as they contain valuable input from other donors or potential  donors.
There are many other links on the site …. all with useful information.
If you want to ask any questions please either post in the comments section below, or if you prefer to keep any questions private, then please contact me via the contact link at the top of the page.
Donating my kidney was the best thing I have ever done. Knowing there is someone out there whose life has totally changed and they are now able to live a full life with their family – is wonderful 🙂

Altruistic Kidney Donation Statistics
March 12th, 2014 |
Author: Diane |
7 Comments »
So far since altruistic donations started over 250
donations have been made. That is amazing.
In the UK between 1 April 2012 and 31 March 2013:
4,212 organ transplants were carried out, thanks to the generosity of 2,313 donors.
1,160 lives were saved in the UK through a heart, lung, liver or combined heart/lungs, liver/kidney or liver/pancreas transplant.
3,052 patients’ lives were dramatically improved by a kidney or pancreas transplant, 166 of whom received a combined kidney/pancreas transplant.
A further 3,697 people had their sight restored through a cornea transplant.
A record number of 749 kidney transplants from donors after circulatory death took place and accounted for one in four of all kidney transplants.
1,068 living donor kidney transplants were carried out accounting for more than a third of all kidney transplants. ‘Non-directed’ living donor transplants (also known as altruistic donor transplants) and paired and pooled donations contributed more than 130 kidney transplants between them.
Almost 1,012,000 more people pledged to help others after their death by registering their wishes on the NHS Organ Donor Register, bringing the total to 19,532,806 (March 2013).

Have a Great Christmas

Wishing you all a wonderful Christmas and I so hope 2014 will be a great year for many of you.
Thank you so much for your support of this website. It makes my day when I receive a comment or someone contacts me through the website wanting more information or support through their donation experience.  I love also hearing from recipients, or family members of donors or recipients. Thank you all so much.
I also want to pass my thanks on to all those involved in the kidney donation process. Not just the front line i.e. doctors, co-ordinators, nurses etc  but all those that help to keep the hospitals running smoothly who perhaps we never even get to see.  I have always said, donating a kidney is a great team effort. Without the medical people, caterers, cleaners, administration  and everyone who works at the hospitals – we would not be able to donate.  I cannot list everyone who is involved as to be honest I know there will be some I will leave out – because I don’t even know they exist as their work is behind the scenes.! Great thanks to them and everyone.  you are all so truly appreciated.
People wonder whether Miracles exist – if 200 years ago someone said “one day we will be able to take out an organ from a living person and put it inside another living person – and they will both continue to live” – I am sure they would have been shouted out of town as a mad person. Yet here we are today with this great Miracle happening.  What will the next 50 years bring …..  I find it exciting just thinking about it as I am sure there are huge medical breakthrough that will happen during that time.
For those first timers to this website – thank you for visiting. To find out what it is like being a kidney donor, please check out the links top left of this page under the heading “become a donor”.  I do so hope I can inspire someone to consider donating a kidney, whether it is to a family member or friend who is in need of a kidney – or whether you feel you just want to help anyone – no matter who.  I have never regretted once my donation and only wish I had more spare kidneys as would so willingly donate again.   What greater gift could anyone give or receive.
So … everyone have a really wonderful Christmas and after years and years of trying to find the proof that Santa exists – he was spotted the other night …….. I will leave you all on this wonderful picture to bring smiles and chuckles from many .
Proof at long last
Proof that Santa really does exist

Elements of the new Organ Transplantation strategy explained
July 14th, 2013 |
Author: Diane |
Read/Add Comments »
Taking Organ Transplantation to 2020: A UK strategy has been launched by NHS Blood and Transplant and the four UK health departments.
The strategy sets the agenda for increasing organ donation and transplantation rates to world class standards over the next seven years and builds on success in increasing deceased donation rates by 50% since 2008.
One of the key aims of the strategy is to improve consent/authorisation rates to organ donation to above 80% (currently 57%). NHS Blood and Transplant believes that public attitudes will need to change if the UK is going to achieve such a shift in consent rates.

July 11th, 2013 |

Want to make a huge difference in someone’s life? Give a Kidney.
Dr. Susan Hou summed it up perfectly when she said  “I can’t bring about world peace, I can’t eliminate world hunger, but I can get one person off dialysis”. Back in 2004 Dr. Susan Hou donated one of her kidneys to someone in India. She may not have made a difference in this world, but she certainly made a difference in that persons world.
I too made the world of difference to someone’s life by giving one of my kidneys to a stranger. Best thing I have ever done in my life and probably the best thing I will ever do. Please read the links down the left of this page under “become a donor” and read about the evaluation process I went through. The “About” link top of page also gives some information regarding why I donated.
Any questions please contact me (link top right of page)

Huge rise in altruistic kidney donors reports the HTA
May 16th, 2013 |
Author: Diane |
Read/Add Comments »
The Human Tissue Authority has seen a huge rise in the number of people approved to give organs to someone they do not know
Issue date: 16 May 2013
The number of altruistic donors, people giving organs to someone they do not know, approved by the Human Tissue Authority has almost trebled in the last year.
During 2012/13, the HTA approved 104 ‘non-directed’ cases, compared to 38 in 2011/12. The HTA assesses all proposed transplants to ensure donors are aware of any risks and that they haven’t been pressurised or offered any reward to donate.
To read the full report please go to the Human Tissue Authority (HTA) website here

Tell next of kin you want to donate when signing organ donor register
March 8th, 2013 |
Author: Diane |
Read/Add Comments »
In the UK 1 in 3 kidney donations are from a live donor. On average the kidney from a live donor can last twice as long as one from a deceased person. Also the living donor has had so many health checks to make sure they and the kidney are in best possible condition.
Giving the gift of life whether after you die or before is probably the best thing you will ever do for anyone.
Please at least make sure you sign the donor register AND equally as important tell your next of kin. Too many organs are lost because next of kin veto their loved ones wishes.
What if you needed a kidney or other organ one day? Would you accept one from a deceased person? Of course you would – so why not also offer one. One day it might be your loved one that needs an organ and if noone ever signed the register ….they would die.
Upon your death you can save up to 9 peoples lives and help many more.
What an amazing legacy to leave behind for your loved ones to get comfort from.

Give A Kidney To A Stranger – Best Christmas Present Ever
December 19th, 2012 |
Author: Diane |
2 Comments »
Christmas time is just about upon us. The time of year when “giving” not only gives pleasure but we receive pleasure also when we give.
Have you considered giving the best present ever to someone – a kidney? Okay you won’t be able to do it in time for Christmas but you can start the giving process this Christmas/New Year by seriously considering giving one of your kidneys to a stranger – or even family or friend that you know needs one.
Look at the links on the top left of this page under “Become a Donor”. Read through them as it gives my pesonal account of my own donation. Step by step; test by test I say it as it was. It covers the operation and my recovery in hospital after and my recovery at home.  Read some of the links going across the top of the page for other information.
When I donated my kidney I didn’t think too much about how would I feel about the actual giving of the kidney. I knew I would feel happy I had been able to help someone but it went far deeper than that. I was quite surprised to feel a wonderful deep sense of contentment in my life knowing I had made such a huge difference to someone (and their family).   If I had another spare kidney I would not hesitate to give it to someone else.
I can’t think of a much greater gift to give someone than a second chance at life. You are also giving them back to their family as the family also suffers when a loved one is so ill.
Being on dialysis is not a picnic.  It does not replace the kidney. Dialysis is a form of Life Support. That is all.
With dialysis comes many problems. Not everyone takes to it BUT they have to as that is all that is available if they want to stay alive. That is – unless they get a kidney transplant!
So – we are a nation of givers. It is human nature to help people where we can. Read this website including comments people have given about their own donations or those waiting for a kidney. Look deep inside you – could you help save someone by giving them one of your kidneys.  Believe me, we do not need two. If we did then live kidney donation would not be allowed.  I don’t even know I only have one kidney. My life has not changed at all. Well actually it has. It has changed because donating my kidney has made me more aware of the vulnerabilities of our own bodies and it has made me take extra better care of  myself. I don’t have to take any medications though because of only having one kidney. Nothing in my life has changed except I watch what I eat a bit more. That is out of choice, not necessity.
Please consider giving the best gift of all.
God Bless
With Love to you all
Di

Tell next of kin and family you are on organ donor register
October 18th, 2012 |
Author: Diane |

Are you on the Organ Donor Register?
If so – thank you!! So many lives could be saved. What a fabulous legacy to leave behind.
Did you know though, that no matter the fact you have signed the Organ Donor Register, the final word about donating will be with your next of kin and/or family.  Although the transplant team has the right to veto next of kin wishes, they generally do not.
So please ….. If you want to save some lives you must tell your next of kin and your family. Make sure they understand how important this is for you. That however upsetting it may seem at the time, they need to agree with your dying wish to save someone else.
I know someone who, after their loved one’s death, refused to allow the organs to be used, even though their loved one had signed the register. It came as a shock to them to find this out. A couple of days later, they  bitterly regretted their decision to refuse, but by then it was too late.
So please …. sign the Organ Donor Register  AND discuss your wishes with next of kin/family, make it clear this is something you really do want to do.
There is no guarantee that our organs will be able to be used anyway when we die. But at least by signing the Organ Donor Register we have offered.  Another reason why I am pleased I decided to donate a kidney while I was alive. At least I know I have helped one person and hopefully after my death I can help many more.
If you do decide you would like to find out more about living donation, then please read the links on the left of this page, under the heading of “become a donor”. Those links should answer many questions about living kidney donation and, who knows, it may even inspire someone to donate.

Questions for MatchingDonors.com
October 10th, 2012 |
Author: Diane |
7 Comments »
I recently appeared on the Tonight programme “kindness of strangers” and later  on the BBC World News along with Dr. J. Lowney from matchingdonors.com to have a discussion on their organisation which was coming to the UK.
I contacted them to see if they would answer some questions that I and others had regarding their organisation and the role it had here in the UK.  They readily agreed to answer any questions I had but unfortunately, 5 week later they are still not answering any, regardless of repeated  requests. They are now ignoring me 🙂 .   Here is the (lengthy) list of questions I have put to them.  Anyone considering joining the organisation either as a donor or potential recipient may want to read these first before making a decision.  If matching donors responds to any questions I will publish them alongside the relevant question.
QUESTIONS:
The system
Paul Dooley is quoted as saying “The old system of ‘Give us your organ, we’ll decide where it goes’ no longer works. We have the ability to take our system to the UK and save their lives.”
Since the first non-directed altruistic donor was approved in 2007, the HTA have approved in total 160 donors 33 of which were approved in the first half of this year. There are also many potential donors being worked up at the moment with 30 at one transplant unit alone.
1.        Given that the altruistic donation system is very new in the UK, that the numbers of altruistic donors in the UK is increasingly very rapidly year-on-year, and also bearing in mind that the UK population, and thus the pool of potential donors, is a small fraction of that of the USA, on what basis can Paul Dooley justify his statement that our system is no longer working?
2.       Has matchingdonors.com had any legal challenges?
3.       Do all American transplant centres accept directed altruistic donors?
Patients
4.       Does your organisation inform transplant units that one of its transplant waiting list patients is registered with you?

Questions for MatchingDonors.com organisation
September 12th, 2012 |

Publicity was given about the USA organisation Matching Donors bringing their system to the uk. Paul Dooley from the organisation was quoted as saying
The old system of ‘Give us your organ, we’ll decide where it goes’ no longer works. We have the ability to take our system to the UK and save their lives.”
Since the first non-directed altruistic donor was approved in 2007, the HTA have approved in total 160 donors as of September 2012, 33 of those in the first half of this year alone.  There are also many potential donors being worked up at the moment with 30 at one transplant unit alone.
It is very clear that our [UK] system not only works but is increasing greatly year after year. I contacted Matching Donors and asked if they would answer some questions regarding their system and how it affects people in the UK. They readily agreed to do this.
Several people had already asked me questions about the organisation so I put a list together of questions. These questions were relating to how their organisation was run; what they offered members in the UK for the $595 membership fee and what support members and potential donors got once they had joined. These questions I sent to Matching Donors on 8th September, and await their reply.
Living Kidney Donation is very keen to work alongside Matching Donors to ensure the wellbeing of UK members.

Donate a kidney to a stranger – here is how you do it
August 30th, 2012 |
Author: Diane |

If you want to know what is involved in donating a kidney to a stranger then check out the links on the left of this page under “become a donor”. Gives you step by step description of the evaluation process, the operation recovery in hospital and recovery at home. I say it as it s and don’t gloss over anything.
If you feel you would like to donate, then please contact your local Transplant Center to discuss with them. I will help / support anyone through this. It is good to be able to chat to someone who has been through the donation process and know they understand how you are feeling.

Annual check up after Kidney Donation Results
July 12th, 2012 |
Author: Diane |
7 Comments »
2 years since I donated my kidney. Went for annual check up (free for life) and here is the report.
We were very pleased to know that this lady is doing well two years following her altruistic donation of one of her kidneys. Her renal function remains good with a creatinine of 87 and a GFR of 61. This is in fact as good as her renal function prior to donation. Her blood pressure is good at 112/76. Her urine dipstick did not show any evidence of proteinuria. I have sent off a urine ACR for completeness today. This lady remains an active campaigner for kidney donation and we again expressed our sincere appreciateion for all her work. This lady will be back to see us again next year.
Well I am very pleased about that. You read so much about the levels remaining low for many years due to only having one kidney but mine are as good as before I donated just 2 years ago.
Bearing in mind I am 60 years old next week, I am really pleased with those results.

Altruistic kidney donation – Ever thought of giving your kidney to someone?
May 26th, 2012 |
Author: Diane |
13 Comments »
Altruistic Kidney Donation (non-directed) =  is a form of donation whereby a healthy living person is able to donate  a kidney, to someone they do not know. The donor does not have a relationship with the recipient and is not informed who the recipient will be.
Giving someone their life back and giving them back to their family by donating one of your kidneys is a most wonderful thing to do. I cannot think of a better gift to give someone than to give them a second chance at life.
If you want to know more about being a donor then please read this website. Start with the links on the left under “become a donor”. You will hear my own views on the evaluation process I went through at the Churchill Hospital, Oxford. Each stage exactly what the tests were and how I felt about them.  I take you through the operation day, my emotions and thoughts and how I felt physically afterwards. Finally my recovery both the 2 days in hospital and then when at home.
I have not glossed over anything and if there was an aspect I was not happy with, I say so. Also read other peoples comments on my posts as each person can view the donation process differently and also have different reactions during the recovery period.  At the top of this page you will find a link to “Blogs” where people have given me their story both donors and people waiting for a kidney.  The “About” page gives my thoughts on why I wanted to donate etc.
So please start reading about what it is like to be a donor by selecting from the links on the left under “Become a Donor” or start with the first one here:
http://livingkidneydonation.co.uk/altruistic-living-kidney-donor-evaluation.htm
You can also find out more about being an altruistic donor by going to these links:
1) NHSBT (NHS Blood and Transplant) non directed Altruistic donation
2) HTA (Human Tissue Authority) non directed Altruistic donation
What I d know is that given the chance I would donate a kidney again – without hesitation.
Any questions please just ask or contact me directly using the Contact form, link is top right of page.

Karen Brown – a “crash lander” now waiting for kidney transplant
March 11th, 2012 |
Author: Diane |
9 Comments »
Karen Brown was 39, happily married with two children, of 3 and 6 years old. She had also recently given up a career in London to spend more time with her children. As you can imagine her world was turned upside down. Here is Karen’s story. Her 6 year old daughter has also spoken of how she feels with her mummy being so ill. Karen’s husband, Matt, explains what life is like for him knowing the wife he adores is so ill.
Karen’s Story
Karen and her two children
I found out I had kidney failure last September, I am what is called a ‘crash lander’. It all happened completely out of the blue. I had been suffering from bad headaches for sometime, and thought my eyes looked puffy, but the doctors thought it was sinusitis. It wasn’t until they checked my blood pressure, and realised it was sky high, that they thought there was a problem, and gave me a blood test. It was that night I got the call to say that my kidneys showed they were functioning at 5%, and I needed to go straight to Brighton hospital for further tests.

Nathanael Adams – life on dialysis waiting for a kidney transplant

This is Nathanael’s story. Please read it and understand what life waiting for a kidney transplant is like. Hopefully it will inspire anyone who has not signed the organ donor register to sign up. You will see a link on the right of this page where you can sign up.
Nathanael Adams – My life on dialysis waiting for a kidney transplant.
I was born with dysplastic kidneys as a baby, and up until the age of 3 years old, I was fed through a tube that went into my stomach, through my nose. Thankfully I had just enough kidney function to get me through the first 3 years of life, before I received my first kidney transplant.

20 Potential Altruistic Kidney Donors
In the last week or so around 20 people have approached me asking about donating their kidney to a stranger.
WOW!
That is just so fantastic. They all were quite serious in wanting to do this having read recently all the publicity surrounding altruistic donation.  Most had already done some research and were eager for more.
If just one of those 20 ended up donating that would still be one person off dialysis and going back to having a normal life and enjoying all thing things that we take for granted.
To those 20 people and to all future potential altruistic donors – Thank you so much for wanting to help someone by giving them the greatest gift you could ever give them – their life back.
Anyone wanting to know more about becoming an altruistic donor, then please check out the links running down the left side of this page, from the top. It will tell you, from the donor perspective, about the evaluation tests, operation and recovery of being an altruistic donor.
Please feel free to contact me http://livingkidneydonation.co.uk/contact.html if you wish to ask more questions or simply want some support while going through the donation process. It is sometimes just great to be able to talk to someone who has been through the same thing.
Again to those 20 people and to everyone – the world over – who has donated or looking into donating a kidney – whether to a stranger or someone they know – a big huge Thank You!!

New UK charity launches to promote altruistic kidney donation

12 Altruistic Kidney Donors on the Donor Panel
A new charity has been launched
“Give a Kidney – one’s enough”.
Dr. Chris Burns-Cox, a kidney donor himself, thought it would be a good idea to have a charity which would help promote altruistic kidney donation and also offer support to anyone who wishes to offer their kidney.
300 people a year die in the UK waiting for a kidney transplant and another 6,500 suffer the miseries of kidney failure while they are on the waiting list.
So far 88 people have found this unnacceptable and have given one of their kidneys to a total stranger.
I am one of those people and am also very honoured to be a part of the charity Give a Kidney – one’s enough and am on a panel of donors who, if asked by a potential donor, can speak with them to tell them what it was like being a donor.
To read a donor perspective of altruistic donation then please use the links on the left of this page starting with “Kidney Donation – Evaluation Begins“.

Transplants save lives
[as at November 2011 there had been 88 altruistic donors with the oldest being 82 years old and youngest 25 years old]
In the UK between 1 April 2010 and 31 March 2011:
3,740 organ transplants were carried out, thanks to the generosity of 2,055 donors.
1,008 lives were saved in the UK through a heart, lung, liver or combined heart/lungs, liver/kidney, liver/pancreas or heart/kidney transplant.
2,732 patients’ lives were dramatically improved by a kidney or pancreas transplant, 156 of whom received a combined kidney/pancreas transplant.
A further 3,564 people had their sight restored through a cornea transplant.
A record number of 567 non-heartbeating donor kidney transplants took place and accounted for one in five of all kidney transplants.
1,045 living donor kidney transplants were carried out accounting for more than a third of all kidney transplants. ‘Non-directed’ living donor transplants (also known as altruistic donor transplants) and paired and pooled donations contributed more than 60 kidney transplants between them.
Almost 675,000 more people pledged to help others after their death by registering their wishes on the NHS Organ Donor Register, bringing the total to 17,751,795 (March 2011).

Become a Living Kidney Donor – Giving a Kidney is a wonderful thing to do
September 19th, 2011 |

Altruistic Living Kidney Donation
Have you ever thought of giving your kidney to someone – when you are still living? It is called Living Kidney Donation. You can donate to family, friend, work colleage or someone you just heard about.
You can also donate to a total stranger. Someone you have never met, never heard of and never likely to know much if anything about. This is called Altruistic (non-directed) donation.
If you would like to know more about the procedure to become a living donor then please check out the links on the left of this page starting with Kidney Donor Evaluation begins. If you follow through the posts it will take you through the whole evaluation process including getting HTA permission; finding a recipient; the operation and recovery process. You can also learn more by clicking on the links at the top of the page including why I became an altruistic living donor.

“The Choice” with Michael Buerk.
This can now be listened to on BBC iplayer  BBC iplayer The Choice Di Franks
One to one chat with – Di Franks –  about my choice to altruistically donate a kidney and the consequences of that choice. Produced by Dawn Bryan this series has been aired for several years now and is hugely popular.
I hope some people will be inspired to consider donating themselves. It is truly a far greater experience than I ever imagined it would be went far beyond the donation itself – and if I could I would donate all over again.
If anyone has any questions about donation, please feel free to either comment on this post or to contact me  via the contact form, link top of page.

Altruistic Kidney Donation in the UK
April 3rd, 2011 |
Author: Diane |
15 Comments »
Altruistic donation was only legalised in the UK in late 2006. Initially no one came forward. Then, in 2007-08, 10 people did so. That rose to 15 the next year, then to 23, then to 40 in 2010-11.
Latest statistics show there have been 88 volunteers who have ranged from those in their mid-20s to people in their mid-70s, with an average age of 52. Slightly more men than women do it. Quite a few of them are doctors or nurses, often retired.
I think it so wonderful that altrustic donation is on the rise so much in the UK. When I went for my evaluation in Feb 2009 only 32 people had donated so far. Now it is 88 in total (probably more now). This year should see it reach 100?
I know two people who are virtually at the point of getting approval and one who is donating soon.
Anyone thinking of donating, whether to someone you know or to a stranger, then read my blog so you understand the donor process a bit more, do some research and if possible get to speak to donors. I just know that if I could, I would not hesitate to donate again. I was not expecting or wanting to get anything out of donating, but I did. Each time I think of the recipient, I get a wonderful warm feeling inside me knowing there is a family out there who now has a second chance at life. I have no regrets at all about donating and if I can give support to anyone else donating, then I will.

A full in depth account of being a Living Kidney Donor can be found here. From my decision to donate, risks of living with one kidney to the risks of donating a kidney. My emotions along the way and why I donated. The evaluation tests involved in being a living kidney donor and what I thought of them! The frustrations and sadness and finally joy of finding a recipient for my kidney. The final pre-donation tests that gave me a sleepless night or two right up until the day before the kidney operation! Then the day of the operation to remove my kidney together with recovery after the kidney donation, in hospital as well as back home.
A lot of useful advice is also given in the comments section of the post, so they are worth reading also.
Please either scroll to the bottom of this page or use the links on the left to read about the different stages of kidney donation.
The links across the top of the page also give an insight into my reasons for donating a kidney plus some useful links on the subject.
If anyone has any questions regarding the donation process or how I felt about any aspect of it, then please do post a comment or if you prefer contact me via the contact page (link at top of page).
One thing I will say is that if I could do this all over again I would without hesitation.
