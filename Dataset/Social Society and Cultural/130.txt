Consultation description
This consultation seeks views on the government‘s proposals to replace Disability Living Allowance (DLA) with a new benefit – Personal Independence Payment.
The Personal Independence Payment will continue to be a non-means tested, extra costs benefit paid to people who are in and out of work. It will help disabled people remove the barriers they face to leading full and independent lives. The consultation applies to England, Wales and Scotland.
