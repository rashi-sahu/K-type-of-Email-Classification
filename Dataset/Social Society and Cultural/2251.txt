Phil Vasili
Phil Vasili was born in London but grew up in Cambridge. He now lives back in Kentish Town, London very close to where he was born. As a boy he dreamed of becoming a professional footballer.
His mum wanted him to be a dentist (like her father) while his father wanted him to work alongside in an electronics factory. Though he played at representative and semi-professional level he never achieved his ambition of becoming a full-time pro. He now scouts in London for a northern Premiership club.
Writing, like football, is a passion he has had since childhood. He wrote his first book length manuscript in his late teens. 'A load of pretentious tosh' it is browning at the edges in a cupboard in his study! However, it was, he admits, good practice. Unable to separate his obsessions he writes mainly about footballers, having had published two biographies and a social history.
