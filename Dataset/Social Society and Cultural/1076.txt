Split-pea and cumin soup from Marrakech
Posted on October 24, 2016 | 2 comments
Today I take you to Marrakech, the red city of the desert, the Mother of all oasis! We went to the fruit and veg’ souk to choose the ingredients for a very typical Marrocan soup in the warm colours of the flag.
Diced vegetables for a stunning mix of colours
Ingredients list:
Split-peas, one cup
Water, 5 cups
Carrots, 2 diced
Red onions, 2 diced
Cumin, 3 Tbsp
Parsley , chopped to taste
Lemon, ½ squeezed
Salt and pepper
Bay leaves, 2
First wash and chop all the vegetables.
Then melt the onions in a pan (with lid) and 1 tbsp of olive oil. Cook until brownish.
Add the well rinsed split-peas, the diced carrots and churn all into the hot oil for a few minutes.
Add the cumin and the bay leaf with the 5 cups of water.
Season with pepper and a little salt ( I prefer to add the rest of the salt at the end).
Leave on a medium heat for 45 min to one hour. Remove the bay leaves. Check the tenderness of the split-peas and carrots. Serve with parsley and lemon juice . Add salt or water if necessary.
Good food is a journey in itself, it bears a story, it stirs your soul. It takes you away and back…
Enjoy !

Beet hummous with fresh mint
Posted on July 27, 2016 | 1 comment
Love the summer colours!
This is a perfect holiday recipe: healthy vibrant colour and gorgeous taste for a minimum of efforts…
I used mint from the wonderful herb garden that comes with the villa we are staying in here in Crete and I would encourage you to grow a pot of mint wherever you can as it is such an uplifting smell and it grows really fast in pots, on windowsills or balconies in pretty much any climate.
Ingredient list:
1/2 tin of chick pea
1 cooked beetrout
1 spoonful of Tahini
Virgin cold pressed Olive oil 100ml
Lemon juice of 1 and 1/2 lemon
3 garlic cloves crushed
1 spoonful of ground cumin
a small handful of crushed mint leaves
Blitz all ingredients in a food processor (I use a standing blender); adding a bit of olive oil or even water too make it lighter if the consistency is too thick. But I never puree it to finely as I enjoy a bit of texture.
Beetroot is great for joints and particularly important for runners or anybody who wishes to take care of their knees. I love it also for its happy colour !

“Ajo Blanco”, star soup of the Med Diet!
Posted on July 12, 2016 | Leave a comment
My Spanish born great grand-mother on my maternal side had a wonderful family recipe for “Ajo Blanco”, or so I am told because alas nobody recorded it and therefore nobody can recall its details… So, to complete my family recipe archives, I can only try to recreate this recipe with voices others than hers… Why does it seem so important to me to do so? Because Ajo Blanco is a bit of an iconic Andalucian soup and because it happens to be at the same time a very healthy and rejuvenating combination of almond meal and garlic. Popular and traditional cuisine often combine the qualities of being at once tasty and healthy and this very ancient recipe proves the point with its elegant simplicity.
I am just back from a long week end in Seville where summer was already warm and dry and the beautiful gardens of the Mudejar palaces where full of the most generous and fragrant blossoms. The photos below were taken inside the Casa de Pilatos in Seville Old quarter. But Seville is full of secret gardens that you can visit or sometimes just glimpse, past a patio of azulejos opening onto the heat scorched street…
Ingredients list
Raw peeled almonds ,200 gr
Garlic cloves,2
Olive oil, 70 ml
Sea salt, to taste
Bread, 100 gr 70 gr de aceite de oliva virgen extra
Jerez or wine vinegar, 50ml
Water, 1L
Grapes or cucumber chunks to serve
This is a Thermomix adapted recipe but any good blender will do.
A fresh and crisp taste for this “white garlic” soup
Soak the almond and bread in water separately for a few hours, if possible. Remove and do not use this water,
Mix the garlic, salt and almonds for 30 sec at speed 5. Add the chopped bread (no crust) and mix another 15 sec. You should get a sort of thick paste.
Keep at speed 5 and add the olive oil, followed by the vinegar and the water. Mix for 1 min at speed 7 to 8.
Season with a little salt and serve cold with the chopped cucumber or grapes to decorate and give a nice biting texture.
I like to serve this in glasses decorated with a mini skewer with fresh grapes and to sprinkle a few flaked almonds and some fried toast on top.
This is a strengthening, wholesome,  cold soup; a godsend in summer and a little miracle of health…
Favourite gardens in Seville:
Parque Maria Louisa – I had a beautiful morning run there, but you can take a horse carriage to it if you are no runner!
Los Jardines del Real Alcazar – The beautiful gardens of the moors kings… A treasure!
Gardens and patios of the Museo de Bellas Artes
Gardens of Casa de Pilatos – see pictures above.
And many more!!!

Chicken in white wine with lemon and garlic
Posted on May 23, 2016 | Leave a comment
In Spring, I like fresher and lighter meals but sometimes I still want these to have a wholesome, restorative content. This is a both a fragranced and subtle dish, perfect for springtime, but with lots of tasty and meaty juices. Use a crisp dry wine wine – something full of flowers like a Sancerre or a Gaillac would work a dream but a dry  Moravian Riesling such as ones we tasted in Prague a couple of weeks ago would have also been perfect. Of course,the winter version of this would be the very classic “Coq au vin”!
The combination of lemon, wine and garlic is irresistible and good for body and soul. The paprika lifts the lemony flavours nicely and prevent them from getting too sweet or syrupy, with its peppery kick.
Ingredients list:
One plump organic chicken
Lemon in brine or fresh sliced lemons (unwaxed)
Garlic cloves, 4 to 5
White wine, 500ml
Stock, 250 ml
Carrot, 1 medium
Bay leaves, 2
Paprika, 1 Tbsp ( choose a hot version)
Salt and pepper to taste
Choose a nice organic chicken and a good dry white wine and this recipe is foolproof! Beyond these two ingredients, and so long as they are tip-top quality, you can relax and play around with the rest…
A smattering of flowers
This was inspired by a long sunny week-end in Prague where we tasted some fantastic local Moravian wines, all dry, crisp and wonderfully flowery ; a proud reflection the beautiful spring flowers adorning the city : From the lilac in blooms along the river  islands to slopes of blossoming orchards on Petrin Hill. The lemon and paprika flavours are very present in Czech cuisine and so I decided to blend all of these memories into a simple and humble dish, such as this casserole. The sort of dish you will feel proud to put in front of your guests because of its wholesome quality and simple but stricking  flavours.
Wash and pat dry the chicken but leave it whole – it will be very easy to carve later. Fry the garlic cloves in a deep dish with a little rapeseed oil. Add the chicken and brown all of its sides in the garlic oil. Try not to burn the garlic so move things around briskly.
Add the wine, chopped carrot and seasoning and get it to a high boil then lower the heat and simmer, covered for  about 45 min to one hour, adding the stock along the way so there is always about 2 inches of liquid around the bird. Leave the chicken breasts down so they soak up the juices as they cook and infuse in the lemon and garlic flavoured sauce. If using freshly sliced lemons, put those slices in at the beginning but if using lemon in brine, put them in half-way through as they will cook quicker than fresh ones.
Serve when the meat is falling off the carcass and you have no need for a knife ! I accompanied this meat with a celeriac and sweet paprika purée (mashed with olive oil) which worked really well.
Here to enjoy a view of Prague in Spring, from the balcony room of Terasa U Zlaté Studnē.
