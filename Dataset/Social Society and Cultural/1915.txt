Promoting a community atmosphere in which individual residents' needs are recognised, independence maximised and privacy respected.
Residential Care with Personal Independence
The New Forest Quaker Care Home is a residential care home, offering long and short term care to 40 older people in New Milton, in the heart of the New Forest.
Quakers have been instrumental in establishing what are known as Therapeutic Communities; the central idea being that by living together in organised and caring environments, individuals' health, emotional and spiritual well-being can benefit hugely. The New Forest Quaker Care Home is run with this ethos in mind and sees itself as one large family home.
At the New Forest Quaker Care Home we aim to provide all the services necessary to take care of you. All meals are provided, to meet your requirements.
The New Forest Quaker Care Home was purpose built and opened in 1977. Residents do not have to be Quakers, or indeed belong to any denomination.
We are registered with Hampshire County Council and inspected by The Care Quality Commission under the Health and Social Care Act 2008. Our care home offers a high standard of care, accommodation and food for people over 60. If you would like any further information please contact us today.

“I can fully recommend Quaker House where both my parents have been residents for a number of years. They have received excellent compassionate care with both love and professional skill. The rooms are comfortable and clean and staff are always kind and helpful.”
