What we want
We want to see the monarchy abolished and the Queen replaced with an elected, democratic head of state.
In place of the Queen we want someone chosen by the people, not running the government but representing the nation independently of our politicians.
A head of state that’s chosen by us could really represent our hopes and aspirations – and help us keep politicians in check.

What does a republic look like?
A republic will give us an effective head of state, someone chosen by us to referee the political process and champion the interests of the British people.
How do we get there?
If we're to succeed, we must build a large, broad-based movement. We do this by promoting the campaign on social media, supporting a growing network of local campaigns and encouraging individual activism.
