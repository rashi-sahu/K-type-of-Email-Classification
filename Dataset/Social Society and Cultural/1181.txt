Retailer under fire over Diamond Jubilee contest

Have your say
ANGRY customers have complained that a competition to win party food to celebrate the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee is not being publicised “openly” in Iceland stores in Northern Ireland – unlike on the mainland.
On Monday, London-based solicitor Simon McIlwaine sent a letter to the chief executive of Iceland – on behalf of a number of Ulster shoppers – threatening legal action if the matter is not resolved. Mr McIlwaine said while Ulster stores were initially excluded from the competition, in favour of a two-minute trolley dash, the situation changed last Saturday.
“What has happened subsequently on Facebook is that Iceland have said they have changed the rules and residents in Northern Ireland can now apply and enter the competition,” he said.
“But we understand they have to email for a code and get the code to enter the competition. The nub of the current complaint is this: it would appear that on the mainland, promotional literature is given out enabling people to enrol in the competition. The question is, how are the customers in Northern Ireland to hear about the competition if promotional literature is not being made available in the store?”DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson said: “In Great Britain you can walk into an Iceland shop and enter this competition but if you live in Northern Ireland you can’t do it in your local store – you have to apply by email online.“It is pretty clear Iceland are keen to avoid offending certain people who don’t share our British traditions and culture in Northern Ireland.”The Lagan Valley MP said he felt it was “unfortunate in this age of respect and tolerance the company is treating other loyal citizens of Northern Ireland in this way”.
He added: “I am raising the issue with the chief executive of Iceland to make clear my disquiet at the differential in the treatment of Northern Ireland customers in comparison with the treatment of other customers in Great Britain.”An unhappy Iceland customer, who contacted the News Letter, said he believed the decision not to publicise the Jubilee competition was a “blatantly anti-unionist decision by Iceland”.However, an area manager for Iceland in Northern Ireland, Stephen McCavery, said: “Originally it was the intention of the company to run a competition for the Jubilee. The prize was that someone in every store would win party food for a street party. For obvious reasons we knew in some areas of Northern Ireland that would be very popular and in other areas it wouldn’t be.” Mr McCavery said they initially decided on a trolley dash which would “cater for both sides of the community”.
“If people wanted to use it for a Jubilee party, fair enough, and if they wanted to use it for something else, fair enough,” he said. “One of our great aims with the stores in Northern Ireland is that they are politically neutral. It is not our job to get involved in the politics of Northern Ireland. All we want to do is sell chips and peas.” He said when they picked up from their Facebook site that customers wanted a Jubilee competition in Northern Ireland, the company reacted by “opening the competition to the people of Northern Ireland”. “That is slightly different from across the water where you have to go into the store,” he said. “I would say it is easier to win in Northern Ireland because to enter the competition you don’t even have to go to the store.
“The trolley dash is still going on. “We have also promised a winner in every store in Northern Ireland through the online competition if they apply.” He said customers are made aware of the online Jubilee competition on their Facebook page and they can also ask Iceland managers for information. “Customers can also enter by logging onto jubileecomp@iceland.co.uk and we have had quite a few entries already.”
