Welcome to Families Need Fathers
FNF is a charity chiefly concerned with supporting all parents, dads, mums and grandparents to have personal contact and meaningful relationships with children following parental separation. We offer information, advice and support services to help parents to achieve a positive outcome for their children. Our Forum and our network of over 50 UK Branches also offer the pro-bono guidance of solicitors and others familiar with the operation of the family courts.
If you want detailed information or individual support for your case then you should join FNF - where as a member, you will gain access to our Forum in which experienced Volunteers, including solicitors and McKenzie Friends can answer your questions.  Visit your nearest FNF Branch where meetings are run by experienced and knowledgeable Volunteers who want to help you.  Some of the more established branches run solicitors' clinics for the benefit of our members.  We also have a telephone Helpline (0300 0300 363) which provides first-line support.
Membership of FNF costs £39 (or less if you are renewing).  This is less than a few minutes of a typical solicitor's time - and could save you a fortune!  So find out more about joining or simply donate.  Please help us to support many others who may be in a similar position to you.  Thank you.
We hope that you will choose to continue to support FNF by joining or renewing your subscription.  Many thanks.

Families Need Fathers CAFCASS speaks out against Parental Alienation!
In an article Anthony Douglas, the CEO of CAFCASS, is reported to have said "the deliberate manipulation of a child by one parent against the other has become so common in family breakdowns that it should be dealt with like any other form of neglect or child abuse.
According to Cafcass, parental alienation is responsible for around 80 per cent of the most difficult cases that come before the family courts."
We meet regularly with Anthony Douglas and other senior colleagues and we have made it very clear that PA is one of the three biggest problems people come to us with (the others are lack of contact order enforcement and false allegations of abuse). We are absolutely delighted that CAFCASS is now taking this strong and appropriate position on PA. We look forward to further action on this front.
We very much hope that the President of the Family Division, Lord Munby, will also endorse this with further Practice Directions encouraging judges to take a strong line on PA in the future.
We will continue to push for CAFCASS and the Judiciary to ensure that better outcomes are achieved for children suffering PA.

Families Need Fathers Families Need Fathers shared The Fathers' Rights Movement's video.Judge Judy...
https://www.facebook.com/Fathers4kids/videos/1403210249709463/
Judge Judy has some choice words to say about using allegations of Domestic Violence as a sword - rather than a shield - to gain the upper hand in Child Custody.
"It's so infuriating to me, because there are women who worked for decades to create a system where domestic violence is serious business, where people respond to it in a serious way, and when women use it as a weapon, and not a shield, it's offensive to the system."

Families Need Fathers Should a dad who is being denied contact with his children by their mother be excluded from seeing his children on the mere say-so from mum that he is abusive?
Should a dad be faced with no alternative but to go to court - and probably spend thousands - and too often fail - if mum simply decides to end their children's contact with dad after separation?
Now we are being told - and apparently the Ministry of Justice is considering acting on this - that dad taking mum to court so he can see their children, IN ITSELF may be treated as abuse if mum thinks it is!
So are children's best interests really being served?

Families Need Fathers Excellent broadside into the woolly thinking media storm on how the family courts should deal with domestic abuse and false allegations!
Could this be the beginnings of a wave of public interest into the hidden but huge injustices which take place in some
of the family courts?
Why is it that what seem to be very similar cases lead to very different outcomes apparently depending on where they are heard? Answers on a postcard... Or preferably tell your MPs.
