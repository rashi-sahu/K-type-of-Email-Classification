Do anti-terror laws make us safer? Whom do they protect?
Since 2000 several ‘anti-terror' laws have been officially justified as necessary to protect us from global threats to our lives. Yet these laws have political aims and consequences.
Anti-terror powers:
define terrorism more broadly, thus blurring any distinction between anti-government protest and organized violence against civilians;
label numerous organisations as ‘terrorist', as a basis for placing entire communities under suspicion of associating with ‘terrorism';
use ‘intelligence' obtained by torturing detainees abroad;
and detain and prosecute people for suspected activities which could just as well be handled under other laws. Read more

UK counter-extremism agenda:
‘Safeguarding’ as routine punishment and collective self-policing
The Home Office programme ‘Prevent Violent Extremism’ has had mounting criticism, especially in the run-up to becoming statutory last year.
Nevertheless its measures are being expanded, supposedly to safeguard vulnerable individuals. Why? What drives the agenda?
What implications for a counter-strategy? These questions are addressed by Les Levidow in this article, based on his talk at the IHRC's Islamophobia conference held on 10th December.
