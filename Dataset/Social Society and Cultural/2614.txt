The iconic torch will start its Teesside journey in Wolviston Road, Billingham, and will be making its last port of call in Whitby Road, Loftus. People are now being urged to turn out in force to celebrate a piece of sporting history as torchbearers, including dancer James Hobley, youth worker John Pearson and former athlete Jon Williams, carry the torch. The flame will start its journey in Billingham on Sunday, June 17, at about 1.15pm. It will then go through Sedgefield, Bishop Auckland, Newton Aycliffe and Darlington, before arriving in Yarm Road, Stockton, at 5.30pm. It will end the Stockton leg in Bishopton Avenue. Teesside torchbearers will then carry the flame through the streets of Middlesbrough, starting in Heywood Street. The evening will culminate in a celebration event in Centre Square. The event will be free and will feature locally programmed content. After an overnight stop, it will then resume its Middlesbrough journey on Monday, June 18, when it sets off from Teesside’s iconic Transporter Bridge at 6.30am. The flame will then head to Redcar where it will set off from Corporation Road at 7am. From there, it will then make its way to Marske, Saltburn, Brotton and Carlin How before ending its Teesside journey in Loftus. The flame will have started its journey in Greece and arrive in the UK on May 18, ready for the Olympic Torch Relay the following day. Councillor Brenda Thompson, Middlesbrough Council’s Executive member for public health and sport, said: “This is a fantastic opportunity for Middlesbrough and the surrounding areas to get involved in the build-up to London 2012.” She added: “2012 will certainly be a year to remember for the town and Teesside as a whole.” The streets along the London 2012 Olympic Torch Relay can be viewed in full at www.london2012.com/olympictorchrelay – including street-by-street details and proposed times for when the Olympic Flame will travel through Teesside.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterFollow @EveningGazetteSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribe
