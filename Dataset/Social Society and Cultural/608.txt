Kenfig Heritage - War Years (First World War)
Community - Sports - Rugby Football
The History of Kenfig Hill RFC (Early Beginning - Pre 1914)
Background
Bryndu Colliery
Commercial Street, Kenfig Hill
Moriah Chapel, Kenfig Hill c.1907
Tytalwyn Colliery miners & workmen c.1912
The game of rugby football grew up in the mining community of Kenfig Hill with the village functioning as a club during the mid 1890's -
the team wore blue & white squared jerseys and played home games on a field called "Cae Rhys" which was located along Stormy Road.
The driving force behind the club in the early days was Mr Will "Rowe" Williams and early club captains included Mr William John Rogers & Mr Bob James,
the latter was father of Jack James who kept a butcher's shop in Commercial Street.
In 1898 there was a 6 month coal stike which was only brought to a halt when the miners were literally starved back to work.
The game of Rugby Football proved a welcome respite from such problems and by the end of the 19th century it occupied (in inductrial Wales)
the same position as Associated Football did in indutrial England. In this era miners would rush home from the local pit, grab their kit & a flagon
of beer, then travel to play their match without even having time to wash off the coal dust.
Development of Club Rugby
Club Rugby of the Mid Glamorgan area played a very important part of the development of the game in South Wales and clubs such as Bridgend,
Maesteg, Aberavon, Llandaff, Pontyclun, Cowbridge, Pontycymmer, Bryncethin & Llanharan were among the best known of this period.
Rugby proved to be a very popular sport & pastime in the Kenfig Hill and surrounding district with teams functioning at Cefn Cribbwr and
later at nearby Cornelly. An official Cornelly Rugby Football Club was founded c.1913 with Charlie Phillips elected as Secretary, Dai Howells
as Skipper and Jim Morgan as Vice Captain.
Another club sprang up in the village which was a Junior Team called the "Coronation Stars" - this team were formed around the crowning of King Edward
VII in 1901. They played their home matches on a field also situated along Stormy Road called "Cae Eithyn" or "The Gorse Field" which was an apt description of the area.
Religion & Sport
The Coronation Stars only functioned for a short period due to the influence of the noted religious revival that swept through South Wales during
1904-1906; this revival was conducted by a noted evangelist of that time named Evan Roberts and which had already began some time earlier in Cardiganshire.
It was said that a converted player stood in one of the local chapels at Kenfig Hill and cried "I used to play full back for the devil, but now
I'm forward for God." This player was believed to have been Jenkin Thomas, father of Dai "Cwm" Thomas.
Kenfig Hill RFC
There appear no detailed records of this early period at Kenfig Hill RFC.
It was the custom of many teams of the early 1900's to have their Head Quarters established at a local hostelry. The Prince of Wales Hotel,
Prince Road, Kenfig Hill was such a location for Kenfig Hill RFC at this time. The licencees of the premises provided accommodation for local
players in providing a changing room & a few tubs of hot water (if possible) which was shared among 30 mud-caked players.
National Coal Strike - 1912
During the early months of 1912 there was a National Coal Strike when mines came out for a minimum wage. Local pits became idle and the
situation became so bad that soup kitchens were set up in the schools at Kenfig Hill in order that children could be fed - a local
collection provided Â£40 towards this task by local people.
In the face of the colliery owners' refusal to concede to a minimum wage the Government brought in it's own Bill finally ending the strike.
Despite these hardships there were many enjoyable times to be had in Kenfig Hill during this era - a feature of one of these hardships
was the distances that players had to walk from the changing room to meet their opponents on the playing fields. Kenfig Hill people will
know its a "fair step" from the Prince of Wales Hotel, Prince Road over to the Cae Rhys field along Stormy Road.
Kenfig Hill RFC - 1st Playing Records
During the 1912-13 Season, Kenfig Hill RFC was head quartered at the Prince of Wales Hotel and they were well and truely organised.
Leading club administrators were: Robert T. Hall (Chairman), Jack Jenkins (Treasurer), Sid Brown (Fixture Secretary), Joe Butcher (Secretary) -
the latter being a native of Cilfynydd and had been a leading playing member of the undefeated Cilfynydd Harlequins Team in the 1907-1908 Season.
Joe, along with Jack Jenkins combined their administrative duties with the playing side of the club as both were regular members of the team up
to the outbreak of the First World War. Duties of trainer to the team were carried out by D.J. Rees & Will "Rowe" Williams - a man to figure prominently
in the history of the Kenfig Hill Club. Will kept a shop in Evans Street & his ice-cream cart used to be a familiar landmark in the village.
The Bridgend & District League
In the early 1900's Kenfig Hill became affiliated to the thriving Bridgend & District League & it was within this competative area of
rugby football they gradually established themselves. Teams within this league incldued: Llangynwyd, Blaengarw, Bryncethin, Maesteg Rangers,
Bridgend Harlequins, Heol-y-Cyw, Gilfach Goch, Tondu Rangers, Ogmore Vale, Cefn Cribbwr, Pontycymmer Old Boys, Llangeinor, Thomastown Old Boys, Bettws & Aberkenfig Stars.
Rugby & Male Voice Choirs
Several members of Kenfig Hill RFC, namely Jenkin Thomas, Jim James, Garfield Rees & Bert Williams were enthusiastic mebers of the
Kenfig Hill Male Choir who at this period were considered to be one of the finest in the Mid Glamorgan area. As in so many parts of Wales,
singing alongside rugby football were two of the major pleasures of life.
Kenfig Hill RFC & The First World War
Kenfig Hill RFC - Season 1913-14
Kenfig Hill RFC - Season 1919-20
First World War Recruitment Poster
In the years prior to the First World War rugby football in Wales was a way of life.
The Captain of the club in the two seasons prior to the First World War (1912-1914) was a player called Eddie Williams who was a fine outside half;
Eddie turned in some first rate displays & stuck up a formidable partnership with scrum half Dick Williams. Sadly Eddie Williams lost his life in tragic
accident on one of the local railway lines. Dick Williams (Dick Waunbant) as he was invariably known was a fine player who played without fuss or bother
proving to be a rough & resiliant scrum half.
The team of this period before WWI were known as the "All Whites" due to the colour of the playing strip that they wore. Over the years the
club has worn a variety of colours including: red & black, black & gold, green & white, scarlet & white hoops, blue & white, red, amber & blue hoops,
royal blue, black & amber and navy & sky blue hoops.
A Family Affair
The team of the 1913-1914 period contained no fewer than 4 different sets of brothers among its ranks. These were: Tom & Dick Williams,
Fred & Edgar George, Fred & George Parsons along with 3 Hawkins boys (Reg, Walter & Harry).
Clubs Playing Record (1913-14 Season)
Played 20, Won 11, Drew 4, Lost 3, Points For 115, Points Against 32.
Football Grounds Used
Several different grounds were used in the founding years included:
Pre 1910 - Played on field known as "Cae Rhys"
1911 - Played on field upon which Park Street is now situated
1912 / 14 - Played on field known as "Cae Eithyn" situated near Stormy Pistyll, "Cae Rhys" was also used
1914 - Before WWI, 1 match was played against Aberavon on a field at the rear of Pisgah Chapel which is now North Avenue
1913-1914 Season Presentation
At the end of the 1913-1914 Season, the presentation of a solid gold engraved medal was made to Will Hopkins on behalf of the Kenfig Hill Rugby Football Club.
Will Hopkins was a respected member of the community being invariably recognised by his nickname "Hopkins the Hall" - this was due to him being the caretaker &
librarian of the Talbot Institute, Prince Road, Kenfig Hill.
Will had been a hard working member of the club committee in addition to being a well known & respected referee in the Bridgend District.
The presentation from the club was a small token of thanks in recognition for his efforts towards promoting the welfare & development of rugby
football in Kenfig Hill and surrounding district.
Social & Working Conditions
Miners earned a wage of about Â£1.80 per week with a half day on a Saturday & the whole of Sunday off except for those engaged in maintenance
work in preparation for the in-coming Monday shift. Dangers of coal mining with lives daily at stake & death all too near at hand, bonded them together as "butties."
A request made in December 1913 by local colliers to be allowed to work an extra hour on a Thursday so that they could finish at 2pm on Saturday was refused -
on several occassions players were forced to lose a shift in order to play their game of rugby - what made it all the more irritating was that colliers in other
areas were granted the above request by their respective managers.
In the period before the First World War, every Kenfig Hil player had to pay a subscription fee at the start of each season. Players selected for the team
on match days were then obliged to pay towards the cost of the jerseys altough shorts, stockings & boots had to be supplied by the individual player at his own expense.
Outbreak of War
First World War - Roll of Honour
The outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 brought about the suspension of organised rugby football - a state of affairs that was to last
for four long years. It also brought down the curtain on a colourful period in which Kenfig Hill RFC had grown in size and stature from the most humble origins.
Club Finance
When the club was forced to disband in August 1914 there existed a balance of Â£20 at the local Post Office. Despite efforts by individual
members to blow the money on a good booze-up for the playing members, common sense prevailed and the funds were retained in order that the club
might be restored when the hostilities ended.
Kenfig Hill & District Roll of Honour
Sadly there were 3 players of Kenfig Hill RFC who did not return from the conflict of the Great War - Arnold Rees, Harry Hawkins & Garfield Rees.
These three men are remembered on the Roll of Honour for Kenfig Hill & District for making the ultimate sacrifice during the First World War.

St Tydwg's Church, Tythegston
St Tydwg's Church, Tythegston
The Church of St Tydwg was first mentioned in 1173 when it was a chapel of Tewkesbury Abbey but an early Christian monument in the churchyard & the
dedication to a Celtic saint suggest an earlier foundation. The present building is late medieval in origin but was almost completely rebuilt by John Prichard in 1876.
The Church became redundant in the late 20th century (Coflein)

Kenfig Maritime Heritage - The Bristol Channel
Scarweather Sands & Swansea Bay (Lighthouses & Lightships)
Scarweather Sands Lightship
Scarweather Sands is a sandbank approx 5 miles off Sker Point on the coast of Swansea Bay in the Bristol Channel.
Scarweather Sands Lightship
The Bristol Channel
19th Century Sailing Directions
This was located at Scarweather Sands, approximately 5 miles offshore from Sker Point. This former lightship was maintained by Trinity House and was
clearly visible off Sker Point - it was replaced with a buoy in 1989. The wreck of this lightship is located in the same position in which it was moored.
It had a height of 2 metres above the general level of the seabed & lies with its longitudinal axis (keel) orientated 060/300 degrees.
Trinity House's No.4 Lightship sank on 30 January 1942 after being run down by the Royal Navy minesweeper HMS Rosette (a hired trawler).
The position given was 51 27N, 03 56W. Trinity House examined this in March 1942 & again in August 1950. The wreck was also examined by HMS Beagle in February 1989.
19th Century Sailing Directions for the Bristol Channel
Swansea Bay - Around the Kenfig Area
Scarweather Sands
The outer & most extensive lie out W. by N. 3/4 N. from Porthcawl; the 3-fathom line includes a space upon this bearing of 3.25 miles in length by
three-quarters of a mile (about the centre) in width. The bank dries up along the southern edge of the shoal, which is also very steep, into three
seperate patches, viz., the West & Middle Scarweather, which uncover 3 feet at low water and the East Scarweather, one foot.
The ground immediately surrounding the bank is mostly fine sand, except near the north-eastern end, where it is mixed with stones and a ridge
4.5 fathoms connects this shoal with those within. A heavy sea is generally breaking over it, and it is rendered more dangerous from the oblique set of the tide across.
Scarweather Light-Vessel & Buoys
A light-vessel is moored in 14 fathoms west, 3 miles from the West Scarweather; upon the following bearings: Nash point, S.E. by E. 14 miles; Breaksea
or One fathom bank light vessel, S.E. 1/2 E. 24.5 miles; Porthcawl, E. by S. 1/4 S. nearly, 8.75 miles; Lundy lighthouse, W. 3/4 S. 32.25 miles; Helwick
light-vessel, N.W. 7/8 W. 18 miles; Mumbles lighthouse, N. by E. 7.5 miles and the West Nash buoy, S.E. by E. 1/4 E. 6.25 miles.
The light id red, revolving every 20 seconds, from an elevation of 38 feet and may be seen in clear weather 10 miles. By day the vessel is distinguished by
having a ball at the mast-head, surmounted by a half one, with the word Scarweather on her sides.
Fog Signal
A fog signal has been established on board the Scarweather light-vessel. The signal consists of a Siren trumpet from which during thick and foggy
weather two blasts will be sounded in quick succession every 2 minutes.
Buoys
N.E. by E. 3/4 E. 1.75 miles from the light-vessel is a spiral buoy painted in red & white rings - it lies in 6 fathoms and marks the west end of the Scarweather sands.
The east end is guarded by a can buoy with red & white rings; it lies in 5 fathoms with Porthcawl lighthouse E. by S. 3/4 S. above 2.75 miles; West Nash buoy,
S. by W. 1/4 W. 2.25 miles and the Hugo buoy, N. 3/4 E. 1.75 miles. Anout the centre of the northern limit of the shoal is a black can in 5 fathoms forming with a
black & white chequered can bearing N.E. 3/4 N. half a mile, the boundaries of the Shord channel between the Scarweather and Hugo banks.

Kenfig Heritage - Folklore (Local Traditions)
Christmas Customs - The Mari Llwyd (Mari Lwyd)
Christmas Customs - The Mari Llwyd (Mari Lwyd)
The Mari Llwyd at Llangynwyd
The Mari Llwyd or Holy Mary was an exhibition made up of mummers dressed in all kinds of garments.
The most prominent figure was a man covered with a white sheet. On his head & shoulders he bore a horse's head fantastically adorned with
coloured ribbons, papers & brilliant streamers. Youths bearing brands, and small boys dressed up as bears, foxes, squirrels & rabbits helped to
swell the throng.
In some parts of Wales, in the far past, it was customary for a woman to impersonate the Virgin, while Joseph and the infant Christ were prominent.
But in later times these three characters were omitted and a kind of Punch & Judy exhibition was substituted. The Mari Llwyd was always accompanied by a
large party of men, several of whom were specially selected on account of their quick wit & ready rhymes.
The mode of proceeding was always the same. All doors in the parish were safely shut & barred when it was known that the Mari Llwyd commenced her itinerary.
When the party reached the doors of a house an earnest appeal was made for permission to sing. When this was granted, the company began recounting in song the hard
fate of mankind & the poor in the dark and cold days of winter. Then the leading singer would beg those inside to be generous with their cakes & beer and other good things.
It was customary for the householder to lament & plead that, alas! times had been bad with him and he had little to spare. Then began a kind of conflict in verse,
sung or recited or both. Riddles and questions were asked in verse inside and outside the house.
Sarcasm, wit, and merry banter followed and if the Mari Llwyd party defeated the householder by reason of superior wit, the latter had to open the door & admit
the conquerors. Then the great bowl of hot spiced beer was produced and an ample supply of cakes & other good things. The feast began and continued for a short time,
and when the Mari Llwyd moved away the leader found contributions of money in his collecting bag.
Many specimens of the introductory rhymes, the challenge from without, the reply from within, together with the verses sung when the Mari Llwyd entered the
house and afterwards departed are still preserved and well remembered. When the Mari Llwyd was badly treated, the revenge of the party was boiterous. In some places the
men forced an entrance, raked the fire out of the kitchen grate, looted the larder and committed other depredations.
A Portent of Death
The Mari Llwyd at Llangynwyd
Video - The Mari Llwyd
Some people think that the bony horse's head used in what is called the Mari Llwyd celebration was an emblem of death, or a symbol of the dead, and not a remnant
of pre-Reformation days and the Virgin Mary. I have been told that in the 17th & early 18th centuries this celebration was called in many parts of Wales the Marw Llwyd
meaning the "Grey Death" - a symbol of the dying or dead year.
The skeleton head & shoulders and the skull of the horse accompanied by a procession of sight-seers and dancers, point to the Mari Llwyd celebrations as a lingering
vestige of ancient horse worship common to the Celts, Teutons and Slavs. In the far past the Mari Llwyd was looked forward to with pleasure but in later times it was
surrounded by a riotous throng, and became so degenerate in some places that it was regarded with terror.
The city of Llandaff annually provides the performers for a Mari Llwyd kind of Christmas waits, and to this several old Welsh customs are attached. Trecynon,
Aberdare, had its Mari Llwyd as late as, if not later than 1900. Llantwit Major had its Mari Llwyd which visits several places in the Vale of Glamorgan but here
the custom is becoming spasmodic and is not carried out every winter.
There are, doubtless, other places in the Principality in which the old custom still survives. But the genuine wits, the ready rhymesters and the clever
leaders & mummers of the Mari Llwyd are no longer to be found. The Mari Llwyd has in recent years returned to the Llwnfi Valley in Llangwynwyd near Maesteg.

Kenfig Heritage - History (Margam) Margam Estate
Graig Fawr, Margam
Brief History of Graig Fawr in Margam
Graig Fawr is a woodland site of 52 hectares sited on a prominent south-west facing hillside overlooking the Bristol Channel.
It was been in the ownership of the Woodland Trust since 1993 and is rich in flower and fauna. Fallow deer roam the area from nearby Margam
Park and during spring the lower woodland area is a carpet of bluebells.
Graig Fawr is part of a landscape which retains evidence of human occupation in the form of Bronze Age cairns and barrows, Iron Age hillforts, a
Roman auxiliary fort and marching camp at nearby Neath, early Medieval Christian inscribed stones and the former 12th century Cistercian Abbey which
later became part of the Margam Estate.
The woodland itself displays a range of archaeological sites dating from Iron Age to Modern times.

The Kenfig Lodge No.8289 was warranted on April 30, 1969 & consecrated on June 20 of the same year.
The formation of a new lodge located at Porthcawl was established by Squadron Leader D.Alun Lloyd D.F.C., D.F.M., P.J.G.D. who was at that time the
secretary of the Royal Masonic Benevolent Institution. He was closely involved in the building of the Albert Edward Prince of Wales Court in Porthcawl
& didn't want to a new lodge to narrow its confines solely of Porthcawl, so a catchment area spreading from Swansea in the west, Pontypridd in the north
& Cardiff in the east was determined to be reasonable for travelling purposes.
Under the guidance & cooperation of Harold Wilson, assistant P.G.M., he approached the Venables Llewellyn Lodge No.3756 whose committee agreed to
sponsor such a lodge. The Grand Lodge was petitioned and a warrant issued for Kenfig Lodge No.8289 which was dated April 30, 1969.
A group of 26 founders was formed & it was determined that the lodge be named Kenfig after the name of an ancient local village - it was also determined
that the lodge would meet 4 times a year in March, June, September & November with the installation ceremony being worked at the November meeting.
The Kenfig Lodge was consecrated at the Masonic Temple in Porthcawl on June 20, 1969 by the The Right Hon. The Lord Swansea P.G.M., assisted by Edgar J.
Rutter O.S.M., P.J.G.W., Dep. P.G.M. & Harry F. Stockwell P.J.G.D., Asst. P.G.M. together with their team of consecrating officers.
The following treatise of the historic village of Kenfig was compiled & delivered at the consecration by The Rev. Cannon T.K. Brunsdon, Ass. G. Chap.
who was also the consecration chaplain.
Ancient City of Kenfig
The ancient city of Kenfig lies buried beneath the sand dunes 3 miles west of Porthcawl. Eight hundred years ago it was a busy commercial centre having
its regular weekly markets & two annual fairs. It had a navigable river & a large sea port and was a military station and chartered borough well governed by a
Portreeve and 12 aldermen elected by the citizens.
Among the ruins of its former glories is said to be a church built by Morgan Mwyn Mawr, the founder of Glamorgan c.520 AD. In 898 Kenfig was sacked & burned by
the Black Pagans (The Vikings) and between then and 1402 the city was destroyed by fire at the hands of the marauders no less than 8 times. However, its chief foe was sand.
No device of this period could resist the forward march of the sand driven inland by the channel gales.
Eventually the city with its courts, hospital & church were slowly but completely covered. In 1445, Leyland, the famous chronicle writer wrote,
"There is a village of the East side of Kenfig and a Castle, both in ruins and almost choked & devoured with the sands that the Severn se castith up."
A great storm of 1607 completed the burial of all save the castle.
The right of sanctuary was observed at Kenfig on many occasions & particuarly by Morgan Gam, the Welsh leader in 1231 - he and his forces made no attempt to
damage the sacred buildings nor did he molest the refugees gathered there in. The city had its Charter of which the 1st is said to have been granted by Sir Leisan
De Avene in 1158 which has been lost though the charter granted by Sir Thomas Despenser is still extant. The old form of local government as established by the
Despenser Charter continued until 1886 in spite of sand & foe.
However, under the Municipal Corporations Act the ancient corporation of Kenfig was at last dissolved & a board formed to manage the burgess's affairs.
The meeting place of the Trustees & of the Kenfig Parish Council is in an upper room of the old Guild Hall (now the Prince of Wales hostelry). This was once
the seat of government & is situated on a ridge to the east and out of reach of the sand.
Thus the name of the ancient city lives on. It is thought appropriate that it should be perpetuated in the name of this new Masonic Lodge of Porthcawl.
Thus the lodge was able to be fully functional well before the official laying of the foundation stone of the Home which took place on September 21, 1970.

Upon these conditions Eineon went to London and succeeded in obtaining the assistance proposed; for Robert Fitzhamon, and tweleve knights, with a considerable army, came to Glamorgan and joined Iestin, and with their joint forces they marched into the territory of Rhys ap Tewdwr, which they destroyed with fire and sword.

They then departed for England; and Eineon ap Colwyn went to Iestin, and demanded the performance of the conditions agreed upon before Eineon went to London; but Iestin refused his daughter to him, and said he should do better with her than to give her to a Traitor.
Eineon went immediately to Robert Fitzhamon and his Companions and represented to them the insult he had received and how easily the country might be taken from Iestin, as he was universally hated by his subjects; they were soon persuaded to return, upon which, Eineon went to Robert ap Seissyllt, and other nobles that he knew bore no good will towards Iestin, and informed them of the plan laid for his destruction; these chiefs gathered their forces and joined the English and attacked Iestin and his army on Mynydd Bychan (Cardiff Heath) where he was defeated and forced to fly.

Query - Historical Information on Kenfig Castle
According to the information in this book published in 1812, Kenfig Castle was re-built with stone in 1092 AD - where as before it was made of wood.
Re-writing History - Was Kenfig Castle 11th Century or Earlier ?
The History of Kenfig Castle possibly goes back before the Norman Conquests of Wales.
According to historical records, Kenfig Castle was once a great medieval fortress rising from the dunes beside the Cynfig river - the castle itself being established in the early 12th century by the lord of Glamorgan. (Coflein).
If the information in this book (The History of Wales by Caradoc of Llancarvan, 1812) has some bearing, Kenfig (Cynffig) Castle was re-built in stone in 1092 AD from it's previous timber form. This information would therefore make this establishment an 11th Century Castle & not one of the 12th Century.
Also, from the information in this book we learn that Cynffig Castle was "re-built in stone" at that point in time whereas before it was made of wood. From this information one can deduce that Kenfig (Cynffig) Castle was possibly a castle or some fortified establishment prior to this date, albeit being constructed of wood.
Kenfig (Cynffig) Castle would therefore appear as a castle or stronghold during the 11th Century and/or prior to this point in time and of which was utilized thereafter as part of the Borough of Kenfig until the town's demise in the 15th century by the incursion of sand.
Rob Bowen, Owner/Author: Kenfig - The Complete History (e-Resource) www.kenfig.org.uk - 26 October 2016
The History of Wales, Caradoc of Llancarvan, 1812
Originally written in Welsh by Caradoc of Llancarvan, this book was translated into English by Dr.Powell & Augmented by W. Wynne, Fellow of Jesus
College, Oxford to which is added, A Description of Wales by Sir John Price. Merthyr Tydfil - Printed by W. Williams & Sold in London by Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown;
And Cradock and Joy, Paternoster-Row, 1812.
This book clearly states that Kenfig (Cynffig) Castle was re-built with stone in 1092 AD - where as before it was made of wood.
The History of Wales by Caradoc of Llancarvan, 1812 p.369-375.
The Story of Kenfig, A.L.Evans, 1960
A. Leslie Evans states that there was probably an earlier settlemet at Kenfig before the Normans arrived in his book "The Story of Kenfig".
"A period of comparative stability evidently lasted until the advent of the Normans, for they founded a borough town, probably on the site of an
earlier settlement which existed north of the pool. Unfortunately, the fate of this town was sealed when menacing inroads of sand occurred at
the end of the 12th century. There followed further periods of serious encroachment and the town was finally abandoned in the 15th century".
The Story of Kenfig, A.L.Evans, 1960, p.12,13.
The buried city of Kenfig, Thomas Gray, 1909
Thomas Gray makes reference to Kenfig Castle being one of Iestyn ap Gwrgan's residences prior to the Normans arriving in his book "The buried city of kenfig".
Iestyn ap Gwrgan was the former Prince of Glamorgan before it was conquered by Sir Robert Fitzhamon & the Norman Knights.
"It is stated by Welsh chroniclers that Kenfig Castle was one of Iestyn's residences. By others Kenfig Castle is said to have been built by Sir
Robert Fitzhamon. I believe the castle, and probably the town, owes its origins to Iestyn. Caradoc (Myv.Arch.II) goes further still, and says that Iestyn,
notwithstanding his incessant wars, rebuilt the castles of Kenfig and Boverton".

Kenfig Heritage - History (General) - Industry (Mining/Quarrying)
Brief History of Limestone Quarrying in the Kenfig & surrounding Areas
The Limestone Industry (18th & 19th centuries)
Limestone Quarry at South Cornelly
This industry at least on Stormy Down apparently continued to flourish despite the trials & tribulations of the 2 manors during the 18th century.
A record for 1766 in the Glamorgan Quarter Sessions indicates that Margam had its own kilns at this location, one of which had been attacked & destroyed
by a mob armed with sticks, staves & other offensive weapons.
Details of the cause of the attack and/or the outcome isn't noted - it was possible that those concerned with the attack may have been tenants of
neighbouring manors concerned about the positioning of a kiln on common land which they would have considered to have been theirs.
Bedford Ironworks opened c.1786 on the north of Cefn Cribwr which gave the limestone industry an added boost
- It is recorded that "Blue limestone from Giles' kiln at Kevan" was used in the construction of the blast furnace at this location -
Giles may have been Evan Giles, a descendant of an old Horgrove/Stormy family who was tenant of Ty Isha where former quarry workings are visible to the west of the farmhouse.
The Margam Estate kept an eye on its mineral rights in the area for in 1792 it fined Hopkin Llewelyn (junior)(then sub-tenant of Ty Isha) for Trespass in
burning lime without consent & selling it to country. In 1808 part of Ty Isha was aquired by John David who in 1809 also took up the tenancy of the adjoining
Mary Frowde's. There's a John David on record as having leased a Margam kiln on Newton Down from 1796-1801 where lime had been purchased by the Margam
Estate from an earlier kiln operated at this location as far back as 1772.
In 1774 a payment record for lime burning by Hopkin William who lived in a cottage adjoining Stormy Down & to David Richard and Partner for lime
for white-washing Margam houses is recorded who were also operating a lime kiln at this location.
In 1826 with the opening of the Dyffryn Llynfi & Porthcawl Railway through the area local limestone was in even greater demand.
Both farmers & private individuals in the Llynfi valley operated their own trams along the railroad under licence from the railroad company -
farmers around Llangywyd brought lime up to the area to improve their land.
There was a two-way traffic system between the Llynfi valley & Porthcawl whereby coal was brought down to be shipped out through the docks and lime/limestone
taken back on the return journey. It was due to the security of this supply that iron works sprang up around Maesteg using local coal & iron with limestone
brought up from the coast.
The most successful local quarries were those bordering the railway at South Cornelly.
In 1847 John Lewis was paying rent on a limekiln on the side of the Llynfi Valley Railway near Pwllygarth in Kenfig Hill & also for a piece of land part
of Want Bant (this may have been the limestone quarry to the south-west of Pencastell which had been operational before 1814) - the same John Lewis also paid
a royalty on 188 tons of Lias Limestone worked at Waunbant between 1846-47.
When the main railway line opened in 1850 between Swansea & Cardiff it is possible that the existing limeworks at Stormy Down also became operational
at this time (drawing upon reserves immediately to hand & exploiting those on Stormy common) - in 1853 the manor court was moved to complain that there
were much danger from the holes that have been left open in quarrying on Mynydd Storrey.

Brief background history of Choral Singing in the Kenfig & Surrounding Areas
The Choir Crest, courtesy: Kenfig Hill & District Male Voice Choir
Choral singing can be traced as far back as 1890 in the Kenfig Hill & surrounding area - the Kenfig Hill Male Voice Party won competitions across South Wales
between the Vale of Glamorgan in the east & Swansea in the west. A number of choirs under the Kenfig Hill banner have sadly come and gone since the late
19th century with the predecessor to the present day being forced to disband through lack of public support in 1949.
It wasn't until December 1971 when a small band of hopefuls from the area met at the local rugby club & formed the present day choir, namely The Kenfig Hill & District
Male Voice Choir. This started life with just 18 members and has since grown to nearly 90 members who meet and rehearse in the Choral Suite at the Greenacre Motel,
North Cornelly each Monday & Thursday evenings.
The Kenfig Hill & District Male Voice Choir are Internationally renowned having performed in many European countries to include Norway,
Germany, France, Poland, Estonia & Italy and have twice toured Canada. In the UK they have appeared at concerts in prestigious venues
such as The Royal Albert Hall in London, Birmingham Symphony Hall, De Monfort Hall in Leicester & both at the Millienium Centre and
St David's Hall in Cardiff.
The choir have also performed in notable religious venues to include York Minster, Bradford Cathedral, Selby Abbey, Doncaster Minster
& St Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin. The choir has also performed in 3 seats of political power at the European Parliament in Strasbourg,
the Palace of Westminster in London and the at the Senedd (the home of Welsh Government in Cardiff).
The choir have also performed at a Grand Charity Gala Evening at the Opera House in Jersey.

Brief History of Stiles Brewery, Bridgend
The heritage of Bridgend town centre around the areas of Brewery Lane & the Brewery Field
Stiles Brewery in Bridgend
The building, presently called the Riverside Tavern in Bridgend town centre was built c.1790's as the suitably grand home for the manager of a
wollen mill that was established in the town during the late 18th century.
The Glamorgan Agricultural Society which was formed in 1772 to encourage improvements to Vale of Glamorgan farming decided to erect a mill in
Bridend in 1790 which would feature a "Spinning Jenny" - a new automated process to weaving which was invented in 1764. The new mill complex took the
wool through various processes that were previously executed at seperate places.
The agricultural society anticpated that this demonstration of using new technology would inspire people to establish other mills across the region
in order to enable Glamorgan to sell more of its woll as a finished product rather than as a cheap raw material.
The manager of the mill lived in a house called Cae'r Felin or Mill Field. The mill complex lasted for nearly 30 years after which the site was used as
a tannery & then the Stiles Brewery.
The Stiles family lived in Cae'r Felin which was renamed Brewery House. In the 1920's the house became a public house known as Brewery House
until the 1970's when it was renamed the Jolly Brewer.
The Stiles Family - End of an Era
Staff of Stiles Brewery c.1897
Mrs Natalie Stiles died in 2009 aged 96, she was the widow of Harry Stiles who operated the Stiles Brewery in North Street which is now
known as Tondu Road, Bridgend. Mrs Stiles was born on April 28, 1913 at the Five Bells public house at the Oldcastle end of town - she was the only
child of publicans Robert & Moira Griffiths. When she about 4 years old the family moved to the Red Lion public house that once was located in Elder Street.
Her mother hailed from Llandeilo & the family were fluent Welsh speakers.
Mrs Stiles was a pupil at Penybont School and later attended the preparatory school at the foot of the Old Stone Bridge at Sunnyside where she studied
book keeping. Through her parents' work as publicans for the Stiles Brewery she met her husband, Harry Stiles. They married on April 28, 1936, her 23rd birthday.
They moved to Porthcawl & eventually to New Road, Newton were they lived from 1939. During the Second World War they both served their country;
Mrs Stiles in the Red Cross in Porthcawl & her husband as a Special Constable in the Arsenal at Bridgend. They also took in an evacuee & an elderly
couple that escaped the Blitz in London.
The Vale of Glamorgan Agricultural Society
The Vale of Glamorgan Agricultural Society was established in 1891 developing out of a district covering Bridgend & Cowbridge of the Glamorganshire
Agricultural Society which was established in 1772 - it was formed to improve local crops, livestock & farming methods. The Vale of Glamorgan Agricultural
Society grew into one of the most popular & important shows in South Wales.

Local Coal Mines - Parc Slip 1864-1904
Remembering one of the worst mining disasters in the South Wales Coalfields
Parc Slip drift mine near Aberkenfig - 26th August 1892
On the 26th August 1892 there was an explosion at Parc Slip colliery which resulted in the loss of 112 lives.
North's Navigation Company was operating a colliery at Parc Slip employing a workforce of men & boys which numbered just under 200 and was
producing 300 tons of coal per day from two coal faces - On Aug 26, 1892 - there were 146 men & boys working in the mine. At 8.20am there was a massive explosion.
The pumping station was 60 metres inside the mine, there were 2 survivors at this location - initially it was believed these were the only survivors,
however, at 6am the following morning rescuers were about to give up when 4 survivors appeared out of the darkness & directed rescuers to where others were found alive
- by 4pm they had brought out a total of 43 miners alive, the final death toll was to be 112 men & boys.
39 miners survived the disaster with 14 of them being led out of the mine by 62 year old William Richards, nicknamed "Y Dderwen" (The Oak) who
received the Victoria medal - he died in 1898 & is buried in Coity churchyard. By his Judgment and courage he led some 14 men safely from No.7 district west.
One family, the Lyddons had 8 members of the same family working in the mine on that fateful day of which only 2 survived - the victims included young boys.
It was 2 months after the explosion when the last body was recovered. The mine closed in 1904.
Memorial
On the site of the mine (not far from the Fountain Inn & Park Slip Nature Reserve) there is now a monument consisting of 112 stones -
each stone representing each of the miners that lost their lives in the Parc Slip Colliery on 26 August, 1892.
Heroism of Dr Twist from Kenfig Hill
From an old newspaper article (Glamorgan Gazette - Fri Nov 5, 1909)
The spendid heroism of Dr Turner of Deri in the recent disaster at Darren Pit, Rhymney Valley recalls an act of intrepid gallantry by one of our most
popular practitioners at Kenfig Hill.
At the terrible Park Slip Explosion, Dr J.F. Twist descended the colliery to the lowest stage, No.7 and remained there with eight unconscious
miners 14 hours in deadly peril. Four of the miners died during that time. Dr Twist was alone save for the unconscious miners, without food, and suffered greatly from the strain.
We are all pleased to think that today he is none the worse for that experience and is ever ready and prompt to go where duty calls to alleviate suffering,
though we trust his services will never again be required on so perilous an errand.
New Kenfig website
A dedicated section to Parc Slip together with the Official Government Report into the explosion of 1892 will be published on the new Kenfig.org website in the near future
- the history of Dr Twist will also be portrayed.

Kenfig Heritage - History (Margam)
The Margam Estate - Margam House
Brief History of Margam House c.1540-1813
Margam House was built by the Mansel family in the 16th century it stood as one of the great houses of Glamorgan until it was demolished in the 18th century.
As the house was being dismantled its owner Thomas Mansel Thomas wrote to a friend: "When I have the pleasure of seeing you here next summer there will only be
the old paintings of it to look at, what a mass of buildings it was," - and his words came true.
These paintings are the only significant visual record of Margam House in existence today.
Margam House & Gardens
When King Henry VIII dissolved Margam Abbey in 1536, Sir Rice Mansel bought the estate & began to convert the old masonary into a family home.
A few years later he was given permission to form a walled park around the house - from this point Margam Park was formed.
It was developed & extended by successive members of the family over the next 150 years. The two paintings show Margam house and gardens surrounded
by the fertile landscape of Glamorgan; the front view of the house is set against 3 Margam hills while the back view looks out over the Kenfig sand dunes
& across the Bristol Channel to Somerset. The house completely dominates the landscape - a visual testimony to the Mansel family's command over the locality and its people.
The Owners of Margam House
Sir Rice Mansel (1540-1559) - purchased & started to build Margam House
Sir Edward Mansel (until 1595) - extended the house & began to create formal gardens
Sir Thomas Mansel, 1st Baronet (until 1631) - continued to extend & develop house/gardens
Sir Lewis Mansel, 2nd Baronet (until 1638)
Sir Henry Mansel, 3rd Baronet (until 1640)
Sir Edward Mansel, 4th Baronet (until 1706) - probable owner of Margam House when paintings were commissioned)
Sir Thomas Mansel, 1st Baron (until 1723)
Thomas Mansel, 2nd Baron (until 1743/44)
Christopher Mansel, 3rd Baron (until 1744)
Bussy Mansel, 4th Baron (until 1750) - last owner in Mansel line of family
Rev. Thomas Talbot (until 1758)
Estate held by Trustees (until 1768)

Appointment of Mr William Edwards - Chairman Bridgend Urban District Council (1909)
The appointment of Mr William Edwards to the chairmanship of the Urban District Council will give general satisfaction to the ratepayers of Bridgend.
Mr Edwards is one of those fortunate men who can boast a good many friends and scarce an enemy, his pleasant manner commending him to all with whom he comes
in contact. As a hard-headed man of business, his services should prove valuable in the chair as they have been in one of the lower seats.
The honour of being elected to the chief position which the town has to offer is perhaps the greater because Mr Edwards is a comparatively new member.
He only seriously entered public life two years ago when he was elected to the Council by the West Ward, which he has since represented to their benefit
and his own credit. He has been a hard working representative in committees and has acted with ability on the group of school managers.
Prior to his advent to the Council, Mr Edwards was best known to the public as a member of the Chamber of Trade. He is one of the founders of this body, has worked
particualrly hard in the promotion of the May Shows and was elected vice-president of the Chamber in 1905 and president in 1906.
Born in North Cornelly
Though, strictly speaking, not a native of the town, he was born in the neighbourhood - at North Cornelly, Pyle in the year 1860, being a son of Mr Thomas
Edwards of that place. After serving an apprenticeship to the grocery and provision business, he obtained experience at Worcester and Leamington and in 1888
purchased his present business near the New Bridge, from Messrs, David Williams and Sons.
He married a year later, his wife being a daughter of the late Mr Thomas Edwards, draper, of Bridgend and sister of Mr T. Edwards and Mr W.C. Edwards of
Caroline street. For six years he was captain of the Bridgend Quoit Club.

Agriculture - Local Farms - Marlas Farm
Brief History of Marlas Farm, Cornelly
Sketch of Marlas Farm
Pleasantly situated on the Pyle-Mawdlam highway above the River Kenfig, this ancient farmhouse has many points of interest. According to Gray, one William de Marle,
who occurs in 1307-44 took his name from the grange.
The northern part of the house, facing Pyle, is comparatively modern but the southern sections, ranged round a tiny courtyard are of 16th century
date and probably formed the dwelling house of Richard ap Thomas in 1543.
The former entrance to the courtyard lay on the south, but it is now blocked up. Part of the building has long been used as a malthouse which has a
large chimney supported on three corbels of early date.
Other notable features are the stone stairs (now obsured by a penthouse) which led from the western range to the courtyard and the Tudor windows and
doorways, some of which have been filled in.
Brief History - from 13th century to present day
Marlas House was known in 13th century as La Marle with the adjoining land owned by the Gramus family. In 1543 Marlas was in the possession of Richard
Thomas who purchased 25 acres of land from Sir George Herbert. In 1571 Marlas passed to Thomas Richard, the son of Richard Thomas - it would appear that
moderisation of the building was made at this time with the constructing of the two wings that flanked a courtyard.
Thomas Richard mortgaged 40 acres of land to Thomas Mansel of Margam in 1612 - this was approximately 50% of the land he owned at Marlas.
In 1642 he was forced to sell another 12 acres of his land to the Mansel family and in 1646 Marlas became a part of the Margam Estate.
In the latter part of the 18th century the farmhouse was home to the Jenkin family who also owned property in the Afan valley and in the developing
industrial town of Merthyr Tydfil. During this period in time Marlas was converted into a brewery and in 1826 the Mansels of Margam Estate installed a
new tenant in Thomas Joseph - Marlas was handed over to the Morgan family during this Victorian era.
The Morgan family still own and operate Marlas Farm during the early part of the 21st century.
A substantial amount of the land surrounding Marlas Farm was sold off during the early part of the 21st century for housing development,
this new housing estate is known as Dol Gorwel, North Cornelly.

Kenfig Heritage - Community - Kenfig & Ton Kenfig
Brief background into the development of Kenfig Village
The development of Kenfig as a community from the 17th century
Kenfig House (now Kenfig Farmhouse), Kenfig
After the town of Kenfig (near the castle) was abandoned in the 15th century the burgesses initially re-established a new settlement adjoining the
Chapel of St Mary Magdalene which they also named Kenfig.
Unfortunately this new settlement appears to have also came under the threat of sand encroachment by the year 1605 and as a direct result the next
50 years of the 17th century saw this village transferred to its present location - the prevailing westerly winds that carried the sand failed to destroy
this new location where it remains to this day as it was protected by Kenfig Pool.
The new village of Kenfig was built along 2 roads that converged north of the Prince of Wales Inn - this pub was built as a Town Hall in the angle between
the two roads. Some burgesses who owned land nearest to this building possibly were the first to build homes here - these farmhouses are Kenfig Farm, Pool Farm
(thatched roof) & Maindy Farm.
Later other buildings were built at Kenfig on waste land further to the south - Kenfig House (now Kenfig Farmhouse) was one of these.
The main water supply for Kenfig came from The Dunes Well (Ffynnon y Ton) which is located near to the Kenfig NNR Centre car park, however,
some of the farmsteads had their own private wells located on their own properties (see OS Map 6" England & Wales, 1842-1952)

Kenfig Heritage - Folklore
The White Lady of Ewenny
The White Lady of Ewenny
With magical river wayer, a ruined castle & legendary bands of robbers it was natural that the area around the the Ewenny & Ogmore Rivers should have a
ghost and so it has - a lady ghost. Lady ghosts have been prolific in Glamorgan. Practically every hamlet & village had one and they came in all sorts of
colours: grey, black, green & white. The apparition of Ewenny was of the white variety.
Between Ewenny & Bridgend there were 2 places called "White Lady's Meadow" and "White Lady's Lane" - this is where the ghost appeared. According to legend she
was always seen with a mournful expression pointing in the direction of Ewenny. Those who studied such things declared that such a stance was indicative of buried
treasure & that the White Lady was a soul in torment over some misdeed she had committed in the past, probably in connection with the treasure.
Some even hinted that they knew where the hoard was but were of course afraid to go & retrieve it.
One day a man was crossing the marshy, mist-wreathed fields near the Priory when he spotted the White Lady, as usual wringing her hands with a dolorous expression
on her face. Somehow he plucked up enough courage to speak to her, asking if he could help in any way.
She turned to him & asked him if he would hold her tightly by both wrists and not release her on any account until she requested it. The man did, holding on
as tightly as he could to the ethereal hands but the sudden barking of a dog made him start & he lost his hold.
The White Lady's face twisted in anger & she screamed, "Now I shall be bound for another 7 years."

Candleston Castle & the Lost Village
Candleston Castle & the Lost Village
Candleston Castle
It is easy to understand this for the decayed ruins have an aura of mystery & the setting of the place which is a dell with its trees being slowly
strangled by the ever enroaching sand gives the locality a ghostly appearance especially at night.
The truth is that Candleston is not a castle at all but a fortified manor house belonging to the Norman fmaily of Cantelupes (meaning "running wolves").
Because of this some say that the name Candleston was originally Cantelupestown. The family had a small manor stretching from the castle to the sea which was
obtained by fighting. We don't know for sure but it seems possible this was the origination of the de Cantelow line whose descendants were the Cradocks & the Herberts.
The ghost spoken of by the children probably comes from a mystifying area nearby which was according to legend an ancient oratory belonging to a Celtic chapel.
Several old stone crosses have been found there - one called the Goblin Stone.
Near this stone there was supposed to be a ghost which caught passers-by & forced them to embrace the stone after which their hands and feet became
entangled in their intricate carvings. They then had to adopt a position of prayer & no doubt they then prayed very hard.
The Lost Village of Treganllaw
The biggest mystery of Candleston is the lost village of Treganllaw. This is Welsh for "the town of a hundred hands" a peculiar name the origin of which is obscure.
It could also have been Tre'r Can Llyw meaning "residence of the Lord of the Hundred".
It is thought that the village was situated near the manor house for there are loads of stones scattered around there. But what happened to the houses &
their inhabitants we have no means of telling. More likely the sands engulfed it as at Kenfig. Whatever the reason the region reeks of mystery & disaster even today.

The History of South Cornelly - Ty Maen
Ty Maen, South Conelly
This large house, lying on the seaward side of the main road through Cornelly was occupied by the Lougher and Thomas families in the 18th century.
Thomas Gray believed it to be the Orchard Grange of the Margam monks, but evidence he adduces is not convincing. Although largely reconstructed, it still
embodies a great deal of an early building. An ancient window can be seen on the side nearest to the road, and a later doorway on the roadside is dated 1550.
Alterations were also carried out by Mr Dennis Verity who left in 1959. It is very probable that the building stands on the site of the house occupied
by the De Cornelly family in the 13th century. It might have been associated with the Knights Templars who owned land thereabouts as their battle cry can be
seen above the main doorway. This runs: "Non Nobis, Domine, Non Nobis," which is the opening words of the 115th Psalm (Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us...).
A pane in a northern window bears a coat of arms, believed to be those of Bishop Law of Carlisle. Forner occupants were the great Methodist preacher,
the Rev. Edward Matthews of Ewenny and J.E. Bicheno, J.P., Secretary of the Linnaean Society. The latter was actively engaged in the development of the local
coalfields, being particularly interested in the construction of the Llynfi-Porthcawl Railway and in the formation of the harbour at Porthcawl.
He left Glamorgan in 1842 on his appointment as colonial secretary of Tasmania where he died in 1851.
In 1960, the owner of Ty Maen, Mr Maurice Sheehan removed the back of an upstairs cupboard and discovered a small chamber behind it, the floor of
which is on a level with that of the bedroom. Within it is an ancient timbered seat similar to the lowest section of a stairs and the appearance of the
chamber strongly suggests that it was a hide or Priest's Hole, similar to others found in old houses and used by Romanist priests in penal days.
Its discovery was not wholly unexpected bearing in mind the fact that the locality was formerly a centre of Catholic recusancy.

Kenfig Heritage - History - Crimes & Punishment
18th Century Crime & Punishment throughout the Kenfig Area
Cornelly - The Village Shop 1797
During the winter of 1797 the constable for the manor of Cornelly was John Hopkin.
A man of the same name (which might have been the same person) appeared in local records in the late 18th century.
In 1872 a John Hopkins was
described as a butcher living in Heol Las and was one of the many locals who had a warrant issued against them following the looting of the
merchant ship "Caterina" which was wrecked on Sker Point on 28 December 1781 - no proceedings followed.
John Hopkins was a burgess of the borough of Kenfig - in 1785 he was disfranchised for failing to pay his rates & although reinstated
was again kicked out in 1824 for failing to discharge his debts to the Corporation. He died at his home in Heol Las in 1835 & was buried on 1 April at the age of 87.
John Hopkins was summoned to the village shop in North Cornelly on the morning of Wednesday January 4, 1797. The shop was run by sisters,
Cecil & Margaret Williams and had been broken into during the previous night.
The burglary was discovered by Mary David who passed the shop on her way to work at a nearby farm - she raised the alarm when she saw the shop door open but
the shutters were up. There were several panes of glass broken in the mullioned windows & a considerable amount had been stolen.
Just how John Hopkins detected this crime isn't stated however he visited a house where he believed the stolen goods might be - he was accompanied by a friend & local shoe maker, Thomas Yorwerth.
The house in question was the home of a William Beynon who was a member of a family which appears to have been newcomers to the area at that point in time.
A search of the house discovered the stolen goods hidden between the ceiling & the thatched roof. John Hopkin arrested the occupants of the house which
were the wife of William Beynon (Margaret) and Ann David, a spinster.
It would appear Thomas Beynon was the son of William in whose house the goods were found. Thomas Beynon was described as a labourer working & living in
the parish of Llansamlet, Swansea. The parish registers show that he and Margaret had baptised a son, William in 1795 - a burial of a Thomas Beynon is
recorded in 1824 at 60 years of age.
Both women were brought before the local magistrate, Henry Knight of Tythegston.
Ann David admitted entering the shop & bringing out the goods; Margaret asserted that she had only "received the said goods out of the shop where Ann
David was at the door of the house & had not entered the house of the said Cecil Williams." Her protests were in vain however as the evidence against them was overwhelming -
their fate was recorded in a few stark words... Both sentenced to be hanged !!

Crimes of Kenfig & District 1740-1840, Barrie Griffiths, 1993;
Kenfig Heritage - Public Administration
Court Presentments during the 17th & 18th Centuries
Records of local Courts held at Kenfig
The Kenfig Borough c.1147-1886
Records of the local courts held at Kenfig contain a wealth of interesting material & provide a valuable mirror of contemporary social life.
Manorial courts held before early feudal lords or his representative were known as Courts Baron. These exercised the prescriptive right of jurisdiction
within their estates. Both free & customary or copyhold tenants had to attend & the recorder noted the rents, services & heriots due from them in the court rolls.
Eventually seperate courts arose from the Courts Baron - one of these being the Court Leet which assumed the particular function of administering justice
within the district or leet. These were petty criminal courts where offences were presented to the jury, each presentment being duly noted & fines up to
40 shillings imposed.
Manorial Courts of Pleas were also established for the purpose of dealing with personal actions & others relating to the land.
The business of the Court Baron in later times merely related to the administration of the customs of the manor & the admission of new tenants.
All 3 of these courts were held in the manors of Pyle & Kenfig, the Leets being held twice as year & the others every month - these were presided
over by the stewards & portreeves. Eventually some of their powers were delegated to parish officers & with the rise in importance of the couty courts they fell into decay. Towards the
end they dealt mainly with routine affairs such as appointments of the borough officials.

The Angel Inn, Maudlam
The History of the Angel Inn & the Village of Maudlam (Mawdlam)
The Angel Inn
This photo dates from the early part of the 20th century & shows the inn as it was prior to extensive refurbishment in 1959.
The view is from the east with the chapel of St Mary Magdalene out of the shot to the left.
The main entrance to the inn during this point in time (nearest doorway to the camera) faced the church & there was then no direct access from
the road that passed along the other side of the property.
The Angel Inn
The Angel Inn
Historically speaking, we find that every village has both a pub & a form of worship in close proximity to each other, this has been especially so in Wales since medieval times.
It would appear that Maudlam Chapel & The Angel Inn have a closer bond than most - having originally been elements of a medieval leper hospice that
was first mentioned at Kenfig c.1202
It would appear that medieval chapels dedicated to St Mary Magdalene are usually associated with hospitals & hospices and it would appear that there is
evidence that the Angel Inn developed from a long low building which faced the church being divided into five separate cells, each which its own entrance.
This might have been the accomodation block for the lepers & together with the chapel, a cemetery and a house for the Master of the hospice would have been
contained within a walled compound. It has long been claimed that the Angel Inn locally once provided shelter for pilgrims enroute to St David's Cathederal & in a strange way this had now been justified.
Leprosy was believed to be a punishment from God for a sin committed by the victim & the only known cure was to obtain God's forgiveness. By undertaking a pilgrimage
to a holy shrine was essentially an act of penance and in medieval times two visits to the shrine of St David were considered equal to a visit to the Holy City of Rome itself.
When the Leper Hospice was built it adjoined the main highway to Cardiff - lepers travelling to and from West Wales found shelter at this establishment
and were detered from seeking refuge at the nearby town of Kenfig or even that of nearby Margam Abbey.
Leprosy was eradicated in the UK by the virus that brought the Black Death c.1348 and the hospice fell into decay. The chapel however was subsequently
rebuilt during the mid 16th century to serve as the religious centre of a new village called Kenfig (now Maudlam) created by the burgesses who had abandoned
the old town of Kenfig nearly a century earlier.
Further Information - The Angel Inn, Maudlam
It has been suggested that the name of this inn derives its name from the nearby monastic Grange of St Michael at Llanmihangel Farm, Pyle -
this was once one of the many granges of Margam Abbey. The inn appears to have been called Ty'n Maudlam in 1769 & the nearest reference to its present
name occurs in 1818 when an alehouse licence was issued to David Yorwerth "at the signe of the Angell".
The eaeliest known licensee was Hopkin Thomas (d.1743) who was prosecuted for selling ale during the time of church services in 1730 and again in 1731
for selling ale in short measures. A licensee by the name of Evan Evans was prosecuted at Bridgend Magistrates' Court in 1868 for selling ale on a Sunday -
he was also convicted of the same offence in 1866.
Maudlam Village
Map of Maudlam showing Angel Inn, St Mary Magdalen Church & graveyard, The Butchers Arms, Maudlam Farm & the Town Hall (Prince of Wales Inn, Kenfig)
When the town of Kenfig (by the castle) was abandoned during the 15th century, the burgesses built new homes along Heol Las near an abandoned
leper hospice thereby creating a village they named Kenfig after their former town.
The hospice & its chapel dedicated to St Mary Megdalene were then in ruins but some of the buildings were repaired & reused as dwellings -
the chapel itself was rebuilt during the middle of the 16th century to serve as a place of worship.
A map from 1592 depicts 15 houses lining both sides
of Heol Las with 2 detached buildings the latter probably being the Angel Inn & Ty'n y Towyn Farm to the east of the church.
During the period 1600-1650 the village was moved to its present location on the Nottage road (possibly due to renewed sand encroachment) -
in the event this was countered by the planting of 'sedges' which not only saved the church but also the houses of those who had chosen to remain.
This now smaller community (as outlined on a Tithe Map of 1846) became known as 'Maudlam' - the 'Maud' being the popular nickname for Mary Magdalene,
the patron saint of the chapel. Though now much altered & enlarged, Sunnyside Cottage & Heol Las Farmhouse can claim to be direct survivals of those depicted
on the map of 1592 as can the Angel Inn and the large house set-back from the road on the east side of the church.
This house was built c.1800 by Matthew Foster as a private residence - it stands on the site of the former farmhouse known as Ty'n y Towyn (House in the Sand)
& subsequently served the community both as a public house (The Butchers Arms) and afterwards as its 1st post Office.

Aviation - Porthcawl - Pine's Airways Ltd
The History of Captain George Pine MBE & Pine's Airways Ltd
Captain George Stanley Pine was awarded the MBE in July 1945. He was a garage owner at Newton & was a pioneer of flying at Porthcawl being the founder of Pine's Airways Ltd.
This airfield originally operated from a grassed field which ran parallel with Locks Lane which then moved closer to the Rest Home. It initially consisted of one
Moth aeroplane with the fleet later being expanded to two. Flights on an up & down basis from the airfield cost 2/6d (12.5 pence) with flights over Kenfig Pool
costing 5/- & flights to Nash Lighthouse costing Â£1 and flights over Cardiff or Mumbles costing Â£2. A collection of Pine's Airways memorabilia was donated to
Porthcawl Museum by Mrs Pine.
Captain George Pine
George Pine was born in Newton & attended the local Church School then later attending Newton Primary. When he left school he helped his father who
operated a taxi service with a horse-drawn hansom cab & two covered cabs. Mr Pine's father later bought a Buick car & started the Porthcawl Omnibus Company with
a converted Renault called "The Toastrack" named such as most of the bodywork had been removed.
George Pine trained at Marconi and made his own wireless sets which he sold in Newton village. He joined British Oxygen Company and learned the art of welding.
Circa 1932 he went to Cardiff Airport to learn how to fly an aircraft & obtained his pilot's "A" licence & then circa 1934 went to De Havilland's in Harfield
to train for his pilot's "B" licence. He bought his 1st aircraft, a Fox Moth for Â£1200.
He flew the plane every morning to Cardiff for a serviceability inspection & then qualified as an engineer in order that he could carry out
the serviceability checks himself at Porthcawl.
Pine's Airways became very successful & he purchased a 2nd Fox Moth aeroplane. Alan Cobham of Cobham's Flying Circus, Amy Johnson and her husband together
with Jim Mollison visited the airfield. During the last week of August 1939 some 3500 passengers were carried. At the outbreak of World War II the airfield
was closed with the aircraft being requisitioned.
Awarded MBE in 1945
George Pine was one of the founder members of the Air Transport Auxiliary known as the A.T.A. & nicknamed the "Aged and Tired Airmen" ferrying aircraft
from factories to service airfields. When George Pine was awarded the MBE in 1945 he was 2nd in command of that organisation & was based at Whitchurch Airport,
Bristol. He received his medal from King George VI in Cardiff Castle.
After the Second World War George Pine was unable to obtain the use of the former airfield for flying and was offered work as a test pilot at an
aircraft company near Birmingham. He decided he was too old for this position & accepted a job in Blackpool instead.

KENFIG HERITAGE - WAR YEARS - HISTORY OF THE MILITIA (1771-1878)
The Royal Glamorgan Militia - Hundred of Newcastle
The Militia - The Hundred of Newcastle
The Militia Act 1757 established the militia as a local volunteer defence force. Recruitment was organised by the Lieutenant via a compulsory ballot where
the Privy Council fixed a quota for each county. After 1816 the militia lapsed until the Militia Act 1852 determined that the force should be raised by voluntary enlistment.
Following the army reforms in 1872 an Act of Parliament transferred control of the militia from the Lord Lieutenant to the Crown & pay/clothing was regulated in
the same way as the Regular Army. The militia ceased to be raised in the United Kingdom in 1908.
The Glamorgan Regiment of Militia was embodied or 'called up' seven times between 1761 & 1908. The Royal Glamorgan Artillery Militia whose primary role
was coastal defence was formed in 1854.
A list of Officers names (name, rank & parish) etc., will be listed on the new Kenfig.org website in the near future.

Glamorganshire from Britannia 1607, William Camden
William Camden (1551-1623)
An English antiquarian, historian, topographer & herald best known as the author of "Britannia" the 1st chronographical survey of the Islands
of Great Britain & Ireland and the "Annales", the 1st detailed historical account of the reign of Elizabeth I of England.
The town of Kenfig and other parts of South Wales are mentioned in books that go back to the 17th century.
The following is an extract from "Britannia by William Camden published in 1607" entitled "Glamorganshire" which is listed in the book under 'Description of England & Wales',
'Silures', 'Glamorganshire'. The spellings in these extracts are correct as you must respect this book was written in the 17th century. This 17th century book is online

Britannia | Description of England and Wales | Silures
| Glamorganshire
The last Country of the Silures was that, I thinke, which wee at this day call Glamorganshire, the Britans Morganuc.
Glath-Morgan and Glad Vorganuc, that is, The Region of Morganuc, so named, as most suppose of one Morgan a Prince, as others thinke of Morgan an Abbay.
But if I derived it from mor, which in the British tongue signifieth The sea, I know not verily whether I should dally with the truth or no.
[ Full article on Glamorganshire will be included on new Kenfig website ]
Part of Glamorganshire associated with Kenfig...
The like fountaine Polybius reporteth to bee at Cadys, and this reason hee giveth thereof, namely, that the winde or aire, when it is deprived of his wonted
issues, returneth within forth, and so by and stopping up the passages and veines of the spring, keepeth in the waters, and contrariwise when the surface
thereof is voide and empty of water, the veines of the source or spring are unstopped and set free, and so the water then boileth up in great abundance.
From hence coasting along the shore, you come within the site of Kinefeage, the castle in old time of Fitz-Haimon him selfe; also of Margan,
hard by the sea side, sometime an Abbay founded by William Earle of Glocester, but now the habitation of the worshipfull family of the Maunsells, knights.
Neere unto this Margan, in the very top of an hill called Mynyd Margan there is erected of exceeding hard grit a monument or grave-stone, foure foote long
and one foote broad, which an Inscription,which whosoever shall happen to read, the ignorant common people dwelling about give it out upon a credulous error
that hee shall be sure to die within a little while after. Let the reader therefore looke to him selfe, if any dare read it, for let him assure himselfe that
he shall for certaine die after it.
These latter words I read thus: AETERNALI IN DOMO, that is, In an eternall house. For Sepulchres in that age were termed AETERNALES DOMUS, that is,
Aeternall habitations. Moreover, betweene Margan and Kinfeage by the high way side there lieth a stone foure foote long with this Inscription:
Which the Welsh Britans, by adding and changing letters, thus read and make this interpretation, as the right reverend Bishop of Landaff did write me,
who gave order that the draught of this Inscription should bee taken likewise for my sake. PIM BIS AN CAR ANTOPIVS, that is, The five fingers of friends
or neighbours killed us.
It is verily thought to be the Sepulchre of Prince Morgan, from whom the Country tooke name, who was slaine, as they would have it,
eight hundred yeeres before Christs nativity. But Antiquaries know full well that these Characters and formes of letters be of a farre later date.
After you are past Margan, the shore shooteth forth into the North-easy by Aber-Avon, a small mercate town upon the river Avons mouth
(whereof it tooke the name) to the river Nid or Neath, infamous for a quick-sand, upon which stands an ancient towne of the same name,
which Antonine the Emperour in his Itinerary called Nidum.

History of Aberbaiden Farm (A post medieval domestic farmhouse)
Aberbaiden Farm is a two & a half storeyed house constructed by the Margam Estate for the Lewis family c.1800. The house comprises a central hall & parlour
in a higher block with lower wings, each end containing a service room and a stable.
(2003.03.14/RCAHMW/SLE)
Aberbaiden Farm
Aberbaiden Farm was built c.1810 by the Margam Estate to replace an earlier farmhouse to the north. The tenants were the Lewis family.
The house has an unusual plan-form for the period being almost symmetrical but incorporating elements of an earlier tradition. The house has
lower wings to each end, a kitchen to the west and a stable & granary to the east.
Originally the kitchen would have been the inner room resulting in a 3-unit direct entry house with adjoining stable.
Aberbaiden is a 2-storey house with the entrance bay offset to the left and with lower flanking wings & a rear staircase projection.
It is constructed of rubble stone under slate roofs with end stacks to the main range.
The front faces south (away from the main road) with openings having segmental voussoir heads. There is a planked front door immediately
to the left of centre flanked by a 12-pane, horned, sash windows. The upper storey has 9-pane horned sashes aligned with the openings below.
The lower wing to the left has a multi-pane window to the ground floor and a blind window above.
The lower wing to the right has a planked door and window also with a blind window above. The west gable end has a late 20th century 6-pane window
to the upper storey & a small flat-roofed projection to the ground floor.
The rear side faces the road - to the left is a staircase projection with catslide roof. A two-light multi-pane casement lights the stairs.
There is a single storey brick lean-to to the right with a two-light casement window & doorway into the west side. A porch canopy is adjacent &
covers a doorway leading into the lower kitchen wing; to the right of which is a wide three-light casement.
To the left of the staircase is a further single storey lean-to which is rendered with planked door & two-light multi-pane casement.
The lower wing to the left has a blocked doorway. A stone staircase against the east gable end provided access to a former granary.
Internal Structure
Internally there are 2 similar reception rooms separated by a narrow partition. The entrance leads directly into the hall which has a large
fireplace at the west end with a segmental head of voussoirs. To its left is a large bakeoven with a segmental brick head while to the right is a doorway to the kitchen.
The hall originally had a rear door next to the staircase but this is now blocked. The staircase is accessed through a round headed planked door.
Each room has a large cross-beam which is symmetrically placed. The hall has moulded joists whilst the parlour has a plastered ceiling. The parlour has a
20th century fireplace in the east wall and doorway next to the partition which led to the cellar. (CADW Listing database)S Fielding RCAHMW 10/01/2006

KENFIG HERITAGE - History - Kenfig - Kenfig Castle
The History of a Norman Castle established at Kenfig c.1140 AD
History of a 12th Century Castle at Kenfig & its Town's Defences
Kenfig Castle - Brief Background
The remains of Kenfig Castle, a once medieval fortress rise from the dunes beside the River Cynffig.
The castle was established in the early 12th century by the lord of Glamorgan & was set at the northern end of a walled borough -
the castle was attacked and ravaged several times & was greatly altered and added to in the late 13th century. During the 14th century it was
maintained but was ruinous by the 16th century. The borough became besanded through the 15th century.
The site was excavated between 1924 and 1932.
The castle was set on a low knoll washed by the river on the west and north. It originally consisted of a roughly circular embanked &
palisaded court some 37m across, enclosing a magnificent square-plan tower as well as a hall and its offices.
The facades of the 14m square tower were articulated by slim dressed stone butresses at the corners & centre of each side. It would have risen high
above the court dominating the borough skyline. About 1300 AD the castle was substantially reconstructed.
The rampart was thrown down to level up the
court and a stout curtain wall was built in its stead with a large masonry gatehouse facing into the borough. The tower was also reconstructed and its
south-west wall completely rebuilt.
The dating of Kenfig Castle is not clear.
The town and castle have been buried several times. It continued in good repair until 1405 when it was dismantled. Earliest mention of castle is 1185 AD
(sub anno 1893). The structure included the Keep astride to the rampart of pebbles and a large bailey (about 8 acres).
Square with rounded corners, sides about 198 yards long. It appears that later the castle was repaired and used as a local gaol.
OS Map Grid Ref: SS80098269
Latitude 51.53028Â° Longitude -3.73000Â°
Kenfig Castle has been described as both a certain Timber Castle & also as a certain Masonry Castle (there are masonry footings remains) -
The site at Kenfig Castle is a Scheduled Monument & is protected by law.
Kenfig Town Defences
The outer enclosure of 8 acres with a substantial earthen rampart and ditch should perhaps be regarded as a small town rather than a bailey. (Hogg and King 1967)
It is clear that a town had been established between 1135-54 AD and had already been surrounded by an earth and timber palisade - the borough was
enlcosed with walls which are mentioned in 1147 but we know nothing of their course.
They were intially of earth and timber and were rebuilt with the same materials after the Welsh attack of 1183 when Hywel of Caerleon was charged
with despatching stakes from Chepstow "in order to enclose the town and castle". The "Town Walls and Gates" are further mentioned in the 1330 ordinaces
but there is nothing to suggest they were ever reconstructed in stone.
Comments
Otherwise it has been described as a bailey.
Salter writes the town had a bank and ditch but does not identify it with the 8 acre bailey.
Bond writes 12th century town earthworks have vanished. Spurgeon gives a full description and history of the town and its defences both of which are
buried under sand dunes (and have been since Leland described it as "almost shokid (chocked) and devourid with the sands that the Severn Sea there castith up."
Soulsby's notes the archaeological potential of this site since the sands protect the remains of the town. His plan puts the town and parish church
outside the castle bailey, whilst noting some houses were within the bailey and do not show a line ot town defences.
Channel 4 Time Team excavation showed defences were a timber pallisade, never rebuilt in stone.
The town was densely inhabited within a relatively small defended area.

The Great Fire of Kenfig Hill (July 1913)
Shop Fires at Bowen's Cross
Press Story of the day
On Friday evening Kenfig Hill was the scene of a tremendous conflagration which resulted in the destruction of 4 commodious business premises
situated on Bowen's Cross. The fire originated in the premises of Mr Ivor Parker (the draper) as a result of the falling of a large Blanchard lamp that
had been hung in the shop window. The fire quickly spread through the shop within minutes the whole building was ablaze. Before it could be contained
the fire had engulfed & destroyed the establishments of Mr Herbert Jones (chemist), Mr Fred Love (tobacconist & hairdresser) & Mr Evans (boot & shoe shop).
The fire was prevented from spreading to adjacent houses but the heat was so intense it cracked & broke the windows of the Post Office on opposite side of road.
The Bridgend Fire Brigade arrived within half hour of the alarm being raised - this was very good for a horse-drawn fire tender. When it arrived at
Bowen's Cross there wasn't any water available to fight the blaze. The nearest fire hydrant was in Waunbant Road which had been metalled over. The final
assessment of damage was Â£8000 (this being the 3rd severe fire that had occurred in Kenfig Hill during the previous 12 months) - On 31 October 1913 the
Penybont Rural District Council resolved to fix 16 fire hydrants in the Kenfig Hill district.

KENFIG HERITAGE - War Years - The First World War around Kenfig (1914-18)
Egbert the Tank in Dunraven Place, Bridgend - June 1918
Promoting the Drive to purchase War Bonds
First World War Tank visits South Wales
Look Out for the Tank "Egbert"
At Bridgend on Tuesday and Wednesday - Rally round and Help to Smash the Huns
Tuesday and Wednesday in next week will be days long held in remembrance in the history of Bridgend, not only as the occasion of a magnificient
patriotic demonstration, but as days, keenly looked forward to when the people accquitted themselves nobly and in the history of the great war made for
themselves a name of which posterity will be for ever proud.
Everything now and for the future depends upon the spontaniety and the magnitude of our effort.
We refused to have a dummy tank - a mere camouflaged affair. We are having the real thing. Let us see to it that there is no camouflage about our
reception, or in our "shelling out" to shell out the Beches.
The Tank coming to Bridgend on Tuesday and Wednesday next week is the famous Juggernaut that broke the line at Cambrai -
The Tank Egbert with indentations on its armoured plates that tell their own tale of deadly combat with the Huns and speak to us of the flesh
and blood fighting in France and Flanders which is one more value than much money.
Other towns we know have done well. Let them be to us an inspiration not to flag, but to put so much money into the Tank that Egbert in its fight for
finance in Bridgend may beat the record. For the information of our readers, it must be recorded that "Egbert" will be stationed outside the Town Hall
for the purpose of registering the names of the patriots living in Bridgend and district and the amounts of war loan taken up.
It is possible to invest any sum from 15/6 upwards.
"Egbert" is due to arrive at the Great Western Railway Station at 10.30am on Tuesday and will be met by the chairman (Mr J.T. Hitt, J.P.) and members
of the Urban District Council and representaives of the Friendly Societies, the Fire Brigade, Police, Girl Guides, Boy Scouts and the local O.T.C.
The V.T.C. will form the guard of honour.
A procession will be formed and with a musical band, "Egbert" will be conducted in state to the Town Hall Square. After the singing of the
National Anthem, the opening ceremony will be performed by Mrs Llewellyn (Court Colman) and speeches will be delivered by Mr John M. Randall,
Lieut.-Col. J.I.D. Nicholl, Col. Tubervill, Mr Noah Morgan (chairman of the Glamorgan Farmers' Union) and others.
Thanks to the liberality of a number of residents including Mr Fred Jacob and Messrs Bevan and Lloyd, each of whom contributed Â£10 as the nucleus
of a fund of Â£50, one lucky investor each day, on opening his envelope, will find War Bonds to the value of Â£25.
Thus, on Tuesday and again on Wednesday, one investor is bound to receive a Â£25 prize.
Also a prize of Â£5 is offered for the best decorated residence or business premises and the School that subscribes the highest amount per head
will receive books to the value of Â£5.
To avoid confusion or delay, it may be stated that the War Savings Certificates cost 15/6 each and area free of income-tax. At the expiration
of five years the Government will pay Â£1 for 15/6 invested, which represents Â£5 per centum compound interest. These certificates will be obtained at the Town Hall.
An investor will fill up a form of application for the number of certificates required. Money or Treasury Notes will be handed over to the officials
in attendance at the Town Hall, who will issue the appropriate number of certificates to the purchaser. These wil then be taken to the Tank to be registered
and the transaction completed.
Five per cent National War Bonds can be purchased for Â£5 each and multiple of Â£5. These are issued in three classes:
(a) Repayable on 1st April, 1923 at Â£102 per centum.
(b) Repayable on 1st April, 1925 at Â£103 per centum.
(c) Repayable on 1st April, 1928 at Â£105 per cantum.
Applications for these Bonds may be obtained, filled up and signed at the Tank or at any bank in the town. Bonds, when purchased, will be issued, registered
and stamped at the Tank.
Cheques for Â£5 and upwards will be taken at the Tank. Receipts for all Bonds taken up at every Bank will be stamped at the Tank.
All Bonds which are taken up at any Bank in the town on Tuesday or Wednesday next will be reported to and credited in the total sum invested at the Tank.
These Certificates and Bonds are the safest and best investment in the world.
Every Â£1 so invested will be repaid by the Government on the date it falls due for repayment. So everything is now plain and finally, it only remains to
make a grand united effort and with one accord to "bank" with a view to bringing back the boys and speeding the peace that only victory can bring about.
The husbands, sons, brothers and sweethearts fighting our battles in France and Flanders are more than worthy of the support of every penny we can lend
and of self-sacrifice to the uttermost.

Pyle - The Great Western Railway
The History of the Railway Station & Junction at Pyle
Original Station opened in 1850, relocated in 1876 with branch lines to Tondu & Porthcawl
Brief History
The original railway station at Pyle was located alongside the Crown Inn and opened in 1850 by the South Wales Railway.
A need for the railway was created from a necessity to ship coal from the South Wales valleys to London and complete Isambard
Kingdom Brunel's vision of linking London with New York & the South Wales coal and ferries to Ireland.
Pyle Railway Station was relocated eastwards towards Stormy Down in 1876 and amalgamated with the former Llynvi Ogmore Railway.
Pyle Junction, together with its extensive sidings was an important strategic point on the South Wales railway system not only
for passengers (commuting from or visiting the seaside resort of Porthcawl) but also for freight & bulk-traffic especially the
limestone from local quarries which was essential for the iron & steel making industries.
This was evidenced during the Second Word War by two military 'pill-boxes' of the nearby RAF Stormy Down overlooking its approaches.
Pyle Railway Station was closed by the Western Region of British Railways in 1964 as part of the Beeching Axe on the UK railways.
In June 1994 a third Railway Station was opened at Pyle as part of the Swanline initiative -
this new station is situated to the west of both the first & second stations that initially previously served the Pyle & surrounding areas.
The Pyle Inn (19th Century)
Isambard Kingdom Brunel (1806-1859)
This 18th century Coaching Inn built in Pyle by the Margam Estate was not only used for its
intended purpose but also as a meeting place of various County bodies until it was turned into
flats in 1896 and then demolished in 1959.
The Inn was visited by many famous people including
the great engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel who stayed at the Inn whilst supervising the laying of the main railway line through the district
between 1849-50.

William Weston Young (1776-1847)
Quaker entrepreneur, artist, botanist, wreck-raiser, surveyor, potter & inventor of the Firebrick
Biography
William Weston Young was born in Bristol in 1776 and brought up within a Quaker family background. He married another Quaker, Elizabeth Davies in April 1795.
He came to Wales in 1798 and leased a farm and mill at Aberdulais in the Neath Valley.
A combination of bad luck, drought and bad harvests made this business venture a failure and he was declared bankrupt by the age of 26. Having lost everything
he managed to borrow money and invested in becoming a draughtsman at the Cambrian Pottery in Swansea. he made engravings for a book and painted the famouos Swansea pottery
- still owing monies to his creditors he turned to 'Wreck-Raising' to earn more money and this brought him to Newton-Nottage, Porthcawl.
Wreck Raising
Wreck-raising and cargo-salvaging had been a 'hit or miss' affair during the 18th century but William Weston Young brought new ideas to the task with his
detailed pre-planning techniques.
He conducted a survey of the coastline in the Bristol Channel around the Porthcawl area and calculated the amount of shipwrecks that had occurred in the 4 most
dangerous areas, namely:
The Black Rocks
Tusker Rock
Scarweather Sands
Sker Point
The result of this appauled him so he made a more detailed inventory of 39 shipwrecks off Newton between 1797 and 1818. He invented an ingenious grab to get at the
cargoes and within the first year of his venture recovered copper from the Anne and Teresa ships which yielded a profit of Â£1400.
The Seaman's Grave
'On Southern Cambria's rugged coast
Where Sker's wild rocks repel the wave
Half in the foam and vapour lost,
I found the seaman's grave'

HMS Swordfish (1913-1923)
experimental submarine built for the Royal Navy
HMS Swordfish - (Ordered 8 Aug 1913, launched 18 March 1916 & commissioned 28 April 1916)
HMS Swordfish was an experimental submarine built for the Royal Navy before the First World War to meet the Navy's goal of an overseas submarine
capable of 20 knots on the surface. Steam turbines were proposed to power the submarine as diesel engines of the period were unreliable. Swordfish proved to be
slower than designed and unstable while surfacing & was therefore modified as an anti-submarine patrol vessel in 1917.
HMS Swordfish was paid off before the end of the First World War and sold for scrapping in 1922. It was initially sold to Pounds of Portsmouth in
July 1922 but was reported to have been resold to Hayes of Porthcawl in 1923. HMS Swordfish allegedly was the longest vessel to use Porthcawl docks.
HMS Swordfish had an overall length of 231 feet (70.498 metres).

KENFIG HERITAGE - The Old Kenfig Borough c.1147-1886
Beginning of The Kenfig Corporation Property (1886) & The Kenfig Corporation Trust (1998)
The Municipal Corporations Act 1883
Dissolution of the Borough of Kenfig on 25 March 1886
Unreformed Corporations - Kenfig
At a time when Sir Charles Dilke is propunding a scheme for more direct administration of local affairs in the provinces of England and Wales, what little
vitality is left in moribund and close orporations is fast ebbing away. In the first quarter of the ensuing year many ancient charters will have ceased to exist
or the towns which hold them will be invested with powers to administer affairs under the reformed municipal system, or they will wield such authority as is
excercised by local boards.
Already the Argus eye of the Local Government Board is fixed upon these old charters and inquiries are being held for the purpose of determining in
what way the corporate funds shall be invested and how the affairs of these ancient towns shall be in the future controlled.
A few days ago a Local Government offical visited the ancient town of Kenfig and invited the burgesses and others to confer with him on these points.
Many interesting records might be strung together with respect to the history of Kenfig and its charter. From a perusal of the latter, it is reasonable to
suppose that Kenfig was once an important town but the incursion of sand has swept it away and the only vestiges of its former greatness are a fragment of
its ancient castle and an old font, the latter being fixed in the new church.
History of Kenfig
The history of Kenfig is usually associated with the Norman Conquest of Glamorgan. According to Welsh history the town fell into the hands of Iestyn ap
Gwrgan in the settlements made by the Earls of Gloucester as lords of Glamorgan.
It was created a borough contemporaneously with Cowbridge, Neath, Avon
and Llantrissant and that necessary adjunct to a borough, a castle, is said to have been built in the eleventh century, while marts for merchandise were
erected upon the sea bank. In the same century the first church was built and dedicated to St.James and the town received several gifts and privileges under Magna Charta.
The Abbot of Margam, it is recorded, gave 100 marks and two good horses for the lands of the Welsh in the territory of Kenfig, in perpetual alms.
The earliest charter preserved at Kenfig is one of Thomas le Despenser (a descendant of the Lords of Glamorgan) although it is clear by references
therein that there was one or more granted prior to that.
The parish of Kenfig contains about 1,550 acres, of which a considerable portion are sandhills. By the old constitution the government is
vested in a portreeve, recorder, and alderman, the office of constable of the castle being held, we believe, at the present time by Mr William Llewellyn of Court Coleman.
The abbey lands at Kenfig were granted in 1546 to Sir Rice Mansell, at a yearly rent of twelve shillings and among his descendants they have since remained;
being of course now held by Mr C.R.M.Talbot, of Margam Park. Under this ancient charter many privileges were granted to the burgesses. They were to
be "quit of toll, murage, pontage, pavage, terrage, quayage and pickae, throughout his (Thomas le Despenser) lordship in England and Wales."
All merchandise arriving by land or water or in transit had to be declared to the constable before sale or removal, under penalty; and no stranger
was allowed, except at markets and fairs to buy from any but the burgesses. Speaking of fairs it may be remarked that two fairs were allowed in the town
annually, one from the vigil of St.James, for eight days; the other on Tuesday in Pentecost week.
Extensive rights of pasturage were also enjoyed by the burgesses and any others infringing upon these rights were liable to fine. The
fetters imposed upon trade read curiously enough today; yet some of the regulations are still in existence for the observance of the Sabbath &c.;
The town baker was licensed by the portreeve and he was to bake good and sufficient bread of certain fixed dimensions; while the oven-keeper had to
provide proper weights for his customers. No corn was to be bought in the market for malting and no baker or brewer was allowed to buy it there before
noon in summer or eleven in winter. Brewers were to brew good ale, third drink and small drink.
Butchers were not to open on Sunday nor to use the High street as a slaughter-house, nor to throw out garbage there, nor, being burgesses,
to sell flesh elsewhere than in the shambles, nor strangers within the town save on Friday and Saturday.
These latter were to bring in the hides of the beasts - a perquisite it would seem of the town officials. The merchandise brought into the
town was to be purchased by proper officers and then offered to the burgesses.
All strangers selling fish were to be fined and the local purveyour was not to be forestalled by the "chencer" in the sale of poultry
and dairy produce. Pugilists and brawlers were to be fined and female scolds were made to sit on the "cucking stool"; one hour for the first
offence; next for tow hours and for subsequent offences to be "ducked" and fined.
There were sanitary laws then in existence; no swine were allowed to roam about or to be kept within the precincts of the town; cattle were not to be milked in the street.
Every householder had to pave and clean the highway in front of his dwelling; no stranger was allowed to buy corn in the market until the portreeve,
alderman and burgesses had been served; except that "gentlemen" should be able to buy for their households.
Any stranger found walking about the town after 9pm and not having a lawful excuse was to pay a fine of twelvepence and to be cast into the lock-up at Aberavon,
pending the portreeve's pleasure. The majority of these restrictions have been swept away; so is the ancient town of Kenfig which lies buried in the sand;
and although the burgesses, now periodically elect their mayor, aldermen and ale taster, they otherwise follow the customs and usages of modern life.
Kenfig Burgesses
The burgesses of Kenfig, however, enjoy certain privileges in the shape of compensation for pasturage rights etc &c.; These they desire to retain,
but as their ancient charter will soon be of no other value than that of an historical curiosity, it is not probable that they will be able to maintain them.
The overflow of sand deprived the burgesses of much of their fair possessions and in 1752, 78 of the burgesses were empowered to enclose a ditch and
allot to 29 burgesses part of cefn-cribbwr Common. None of these allotments were to be sold, save at a fixed price and never to a stranger to the exclusion of a burgess.
Twenty-nine burgesses were represented at the inquiry held a few days ago and as Margam was often mentioned in common with Kenfig in the privileges of the
ancient charter, so we find the newly-constituted authority at Margam - the local board - represented on the inquiry.
That body suggested that the property of the Kenfig burgesses should be invested in Consols, while the burgesses themselves made various suggestions.
Mr E.P.Burd, the Local Government Board Inspector, elicited the information that the monetary possessions of the burgesses consisted of a bond from
Mr.C.R.M.Talbot for the sum of Â£1.600 for land which they had sold that gentleman at Kenfig-hill and Gwainycymla in 1841; and Â£100 from the South
Wales Railway Company for compensation for constructing their railway over the common lands of the borough.
Twenty-nine of the burgesse received 11s per annum more than others on account of some improvements made by their ancestors. There was a sum of Â£80
divisable among the burgesses annually; the interest on the principal paid by Mr Talbot for aquiring that land. The burgesses wished to retain this monetary
interest in perpetuity but the inspector explained that the corporation would shortly be done away with entirely; and that as soon as the present people die,
the members who had formed the corporation would die too.
Finding this suggestion was not tenable, the burgesses severally advocated that the money should be used to keep the sand back; to provide a
bathing house or private hotel; or to obtain a proper water supply. It was also suggested that the funds should be used to found a classical or agricultural
scholarship in connection with the University College at Cardiff.
The ultimate course to be adopted will be made known later on; but the final expression of opinion among the burgesses at the close of the enquiry was
that the common lands should not be sold on the dissolution of the corporation.

Society of Merchant Venturers
Sir James LaRoche (or Laroche), 1st Baronet was a master of the Society of Merchant Venturers in 1782-83. This society is a private
entrepreneurial and charitable organisation located in Bristol.
The Society of Merchant Venturers dates back to a 13th century guild which went on to fund John Cabot's voyage to Newfoundland before it received
it's Royal Charter in 1552. The society was synonymous with the government of Bristol especially its port and it played a big part in the building of
the Clifton Suspension Bridge & the Great Western Railway. It was also involved with the development of Bristol University.

Alongside the path leading to the porch of St James Church lay a slab to the memory of Sir James LaRoche, Bart., who died in 1804 aged 70 and
of his wife, Dame Elizabeth LaRoche who died in 1824.
This Sir James was the grandson of a Peter Crothaire of Bordeaux who came to England in the

On settling in England, Crothaire changed his name to LaRoche.
His eldest son, John, born in 1700 was M.P. for Bodmin and was the father of Sir James, who was born in 1734. The latter lived at Over,
Gloucester and was also M.P. for Bodmin. He was created a baronet in 1776 and following the death of his first wife he settled in Wales,
marrying Elizabeth Thursley, widow at Llangynwyd on July 13th, 1795.
It is believed Sir James La Roche once lived at Pyle Cottage and later moved to Longland Farm in Pyle.

Southerndown - The Rest Convalescent Home
The Rest Convalescent Home, Southerndown
Opened as a St John auxiliary military hospital in 1916
Opened for Wounded Soldiers
Great Sacrifice of the Working Classes
The "Rest" Convalescent Home at Southerndown was opened on Saturday as a St John auxiliary military hospital.
As in the case of the Porthcawl "Rest" the institution has been handed over for the winter months, together with the winter staff, to the St David's
Centre of the St John Ambulance Association and will be staffed by members of the association, whom the British Red Cross Society will be invited to assist.
The commandant is Mrs Kate Lewis; the matron Miss Ruffle and the medical officer, Dr. W. Edmund Thomas, Bridgend.
Lord Aberdare, who is one of the vice-presidents of the St David's Centre, presided at the inaugural ceremony and was supported on the platform by
Colonel J.P. Turbervill (chairman of the "Rest" Committee), Canon David Davies, Mr Herbert Lewis (deputy commissioner for Wales of the Order of St John)
and Mr E.M. Corbett, Cardiff (member of the Executive committee of the St David's Centre).
There were also present Mr, Mrs and Miss Ingledew, Cardiff; Colonel, Mrs and Miss Denniss; Colonel Wallace; Colonel, Mrs and Miss Arnallt Jones; Mrs Oakden
Fisher, Radyr; the Rev. David Phillips, Vicar of Newcastle, Bridgend; the Rev. T.D. Bevan, Vicar of Ewenny; the Rev. M. Evanson, Merthyrmawr; Mrs Vernon Hartshorn,
Maesteg; Mrs Bramley, commandant of the British Red Cross Hospital, Bridgend; Miss Booker, commandant of the British Red Cross Hospital, Slon; Dr and Mrs W. Edmund
Thomas, Bridgend; Mr A. Williams, secretary of the "Rests"; Mr D.T. Alexander; Mr and Mrs Pardoe, Barry; Mr Evan David, Blaengarw; Mr and Mrs H.O. Irvine, Southerndown;
Mr and Mrs Davison, Pontypridd; Miss Lambton, matron, Porthcawl "Rest"; Sister Carr, Mrs Lewis, widow of Dr. Lewis, founder of the Porthcawl "Rest"; the Rev. D.T. Griffiths,
vicar of St Bride's Major and others.
Lord Aberdare said it was a proud and satisfactory thing to all dwellers in the land of Morgan that, while their county had been, if not the premier county,
certainly the second in the field as a recruiting area, they were also second to none in providing hospital accommodation for wounded soldiers.
Every corner of the county was being used for this purpose and every rank and every class were represented in this good work, but in the handing over
of the "Rests" it was the old people and the young children who were making the greatest sacrifices and he believed they were doing it willingly for the sake
of those who were wounded.
His lordship concluded by handing over the building, on behalf of the "Rest" Committee to Mr E.M. Corbett, as representing the St John Ambulance Association.
Mr E.M. Corbett said that when the history of the Southerndown "Rest" came to be written it would be one of the brightest pages which dealt with the period
of its existence when it ministered to the health and aided the recuperation of those men who had been willing to make the greatest sacrifice of all to guard these shores.
Though the building was nominally handed over to the Hospital of St John, the assistance of British Red Cross Society nurses would be asked for, and their
services accepted with the greatest alacrity and satisfaction.
Canon David Davies having conducted the religious part of the ceremony, Colonel Wallace proposed a vote of thanks to the "Rest" Committee and said it was a
great boon to have auxiliary hosptials such as that to which to send the patients.
Colonel Denniss, seconding, said that if we were to get any good out of the war, as he believed we should, one of the greatest things would be the magnificent
expression of sympathy which was evoked between one class and another and between all members of the community. Colonel J.P. Turbervill, responding for the "Rest"
Committee, said the working classes formed a majority of the subscribers to the institution and more than half the subscriptions came from them.
The handing over of the "Rest" was easy enough for some of them to agree to, but, on the part of the working classes, it was a very great sacrifice. (Hear, hear)
Their representatives said that no sacrifice was too great to make for those who had been wounded in the war. A vote of thanks was also passed to Lord Aberdare,
on the proposition of Col. Arnallt Jones, seconded by the Rev. David Phillips, Vicar of Newcastle, Bridgend.
Mr Herbert Lewis read a letter from the Hon. Arthur Stanley, M.V.O., M.P., chairman of the Joint War Committee, offering congratulations on the
good work of the Order of St John and a letter from Colonel Hepburn, of the 3rd Western General Hospital, acknowledging the great assiatance he had
received from the Order.
Mr Lewis said that in Wales alone 25,000 beds were set apart for the reception and nursing of the wounded and in Glamorgan the Order of St John had 500
beds and he believed the British Red Cross Society had about the same number. At Porthcawl there was accommodation for 175 beds and at Southerndown at least 60 beds.
It was hoped by the medical authorities and the Army Council that they would deal with those who came direct from the field. Mr Lewis thanked the nurses, who,
he said, came at no cost to the society, and, in most instances, went so far as to pay their own railway fares.

Life in the Kenfig Hill area before the outbreak of World War I
Lecture on Education at Elim Chapel - February 1914
Sir Edward Anwyl (1866-1914)
Edward Anwyl was a Celtic scholar - born August 5, 1866 at Chester he was educated at the King's School, Chester and at Oriel &Mansfield; colleges,
Oxford. He became professor of Welsh at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth in 1892 and later professor of Comparative Philology.
He was appointed 1st principal of Monmouthshire Training College, Caerleon in 1913 - he died on August 8, 1914.
He was a member of the University of Wales Theological Board, the central Welsh Board, the Royal Commission on Ancient Monuments (Wales) and the Council
of the National Library of Wales. He was also a lay preacher among the independants.
He was a great scholar and was in the forefront of Welsh cultural life & activities. He was knighted in 1911.
Lecture on Education
At Elim Congregational Chapel on Friday evening, under the auspices of the Young Liberal's League, a lecture on "Education in the Modern State" was given by
Sir Edward Anwyl. The chair was taken by Mr John Matthews.
At the commencement of his lecture Sir Edward delivered a few words in the vernacular. He dwelt on the importance of education in the modern state
and traced the progress of education from primitive times up to the present day.
Even among savage tribes education was non-existent and the traditions of the tribes were carefully preserved and handed down from father to son,
and the domestic arts from mother to daughter. Education was a prominent factor in the old Greek civilisation and rose to great heights.
Even then the State as such did not take a prominent part in systems of education.
It was the city that was the dominant factor. Under the influence of Greek civilisation education spread as far as Asia Minor and Egypt where an
excellent school was founded at Alexandria. To the Greek civilisation they owed the introduction of science. Strange as it seemed, they owed much to the
Arabs for it was through them that our system of figures was introduced, which did away with the cumbrous Roman numerals.
Cont.,
After the fall of Grecian civilisation arose the Roman rule to which we were much indebted. Then after the conquest of Rome by savage nations Education
received a severe blow and Europe during the dark ages was set back for hundreds of years.
Wonderful to relate, it was from Ireland that the dawn came and Irish monks who had retained much of Latin learning crossed over to the Continent
and established schools. Not even after the Reformation did the State take any active part in educating the masses.
Indeed, it was only in comparatively recent years that the education of the masses had received any attention. Even the books of E.J. Locke and
others education meant the training of the classes to rule. We were much indebted to the Church for imparting education from the middle ages onward.
Education at that time was solely in the hands of Christian bodies. He (Sir Edward) was pleased to note the zeal for education that existed
in Wales, notably in Glamorgan. But it was a mistake to imagine that such zeal existed all over England. He had had much to do with counties where the
labouring classes were quite apathetic. Such was not the case, however, in the great industrial centres. He was pleased to note the attention paid to
the applied arts at the present day.
Much attention should be paid to writing and in instructing pupils to express themselves correctly. Reading also should receive attention.
A vote of thanks to the lecturer was proposed by the Rev. T.M. Williams, Pisgah and seconded by the Rev. Dan Williams, Elim and Mr D.H. Price also spoke.

Porthcawl - The Rest Convalescent Home
The Rest Convalescent Home, Porthcawl
History of a respite by the sea for the relief of the suffering
Brief History
A request was made to Florence Nightingale in November 1871 by Charlotte Lewis, the wife of Dr James Lewis for her advice on the design
of a new convalescent home which was proposed to be built near Porthcawl. Florence Nighingale wrote, "Other people begin with a prospectus, great names, a
secretary, a public meeting & a castle in the air. You begin with a cottage, a few suffering people who alas number a great many & your own noble
personal exertions and wise practical benevolence".
The imposing dressed-stone building which emerged from that scheme remains an enduring monument to all involved in its creation. Its origins
started a decade earlier by the doctor and his wife in a more modest enterprise & in a practical scheme for the relief of the suffering.
The Rest's Founder
James Lewis FRCS, MRCP was born in 1817 at Michaelston-super-Ely & was a claimed descendant from one of Glamorgan's ancient gentry families.
He trained at Guy's Hospital in London where he qualified as a Physician & Surgeon. Following his marriage to Charlotte Lynch Blosse he returned
to South Wales and established himself in general practice in Maesteg in the Llynfi Valley.
The industrial communities provided Dr Lewis with the majority of his patients gaining first-hand experience in treating the sick & injured iron workers,
colliers, quarrymen and their families - this convinced him for the need of some sort of convalescent home for the working man and his dependents.
He looked to the coast & to the parish of Newton Nottage near Porthcawl with its limestone downs, extensive bays, pure water & mild climate.
The doctor & his wife purchased 3 small cottages with the help of donations and in the summer of 1862 opened their doors to a few of his patients.
The success of this exceeded their expectations which resulted in 'The Rest' becoming a home by the sea.
The Rest Cottages are situated on New Road, Porthcawl. The lease on these cottages was purchased in 1862 and thus was the beginning of The Rest Convelescent Home in Porthcawl.
The response from benefactors & patients within the first 12 months reinforced the doctor's conviction of the needs of a convalescent home & this
encouraged him to launch an appeal throughout the county to landowners, iron masters, colliery proprietors and the public at large. The success of that
appeal can be gauged from the impressive list of names on the founders board.
Plans for a building were drawn up with an estimation of building costs in the region of Â£14,700 to complete the project -
this was exclusive of the cost of the furnishings.
The Margam Estate
In January 1874 the site offered by Mr C R M Talbot of the Margam Estate of 10 acres of land overlooking Rest Bay had been accepted.
The appeal for funds continued by the then formed committee of trustees. It was nearly a decade later before the dream of Dr Lewis was to be
realized due to lack of funds; the original plans were scaled down - it was agreed to build only half the main block together with kitchens at a cost of just of Â£4,000.
The Rest committee assured its supporters that as the building was designed on a block system it could be erected in stages - work commenced on its
erection & in July 1878 the new Rest received its first patients. Initially these were only male patients but with the completion of the central block in
1893 women patients were also admitted. Building works continued with the west wing being completed by 1901 making it also possible to accommodate children.
Finally in 1909 the building was completed with the addition of the east wing providing an assembly hall & with more wards above.
The First World War
At the end of 1915 the premises were put at the disposal of the St John's Ambulance Association as an Auxiliary War Hospital & continued in this
role for the remainder of the Great War. During this period almost 2,500 casualties from the British, Australian, New Zealand & Canadian forces
received treatment at The Rest. There is an original autograph book signed by some of the injured servicemen that stayed at The Rest during this time.
The Second World War
At the end of 1939 the military authorities once again requisitioned The Rest for the duration of the war. It would be 7 years before The Rest
reverted to its original full civilian usage.

Private George James Crocombe - 10th Lancashire Fusiliers
Age 21 from Evans Street, Kenfig Hill
Killed in Action - Kenfig Hill Boy and his Pals
Information has been received from France of the death in action of Private George Jas. Crocombe, 10th Lancs. Fusiliers, whose home is at Evan Street, Kenfig Hill.
Pte. Crocombe, who was only 21, had been out at the front for about 12 months and some measure of the esteem in which he was held by his
pals may be gathered from the following letter addressed to his mother:
It is with the deepest regret, and the regret of my comrades, that I am writing to let you know that your son was killed in action on the 26th May.
He was not with any of his Kenfig Hill chums at the time, as he was out with the battalion bombers. We all felt very much the parting with such a fine fellow as he was.
He was a good soldier and was well liked by all who knew him.
On behalf of all the Kenfig Hill boys out here and the remainder of his Company, we offer you our deepest sympathy.
In addition to the writer, Sergt. Bevan, this letter is signed by the following: Sergts. Smith, Edwards and Hitchings, Cpl. Reed, and Pres. J.J. Davies,
W.J. Jones, A.J. Dyer, G. Harris, W. Howells and T. Almond.
All these are Kenfig Hill boys who enlisted at the same time as Pte. Crocombe and have been able to keep together.

KENFIG MARITIME HERITAGE - The Development of Porthcawl
James Brogden (1832-1907)
Kenfig Industrial Heritage - Porthcawl Town, Docks/Dyffryn Llynfi & Porthcawl Railway
Obituary: Death of Mr James Brogden
Maesteg and Tondu Ironworks Recalled
We regret to have to announce the death of Mr James Brogden, which occurred at the Esplanade Hotel, Porthcawl, on Saturday morning.
Mr Brogden had not enjoyed robust health for a considerable time past and he had been confined to his bed for several weeks. His medical
attendant was Dr Hartland, Porthcawl.
Mr Brogden was born in Manchester in the year 1832 and came to Porthcawl when about twenty years of age with his father and brothers.
His father Mr John Brogden, was one of the big iron manufacturers and contractors of 50 years ago and the family were closely
identified with the industrial life of Tondu and Maesteg for years.
At Tondu back in the forties, there were a number of blast furnaces owned by Sir Robert Price for the smelting of iron ore obtained from the Llynfi Valley.
The Tondu ironworks were purchased in 1853 by a company formed by Mr John Brogden under the name of Messrs. J. Brogden and Sons, and Mr James Brogden
was for a number of years the manager of the works, residing during that peiod at Tondu House, now the residence of Messrs. North's Navigation Collieries Co., Ltd
who eventually acquired the works and collieries formerly owned by Messrs. Brogden.
The company carried on a very extensive iron manufacturing business and also acquired mineral property at Maesteg, Ogmore Vale and Aberdare.
In 1864 they sank the Garth pit at Maesteg, the sinking operations being carried out by the late Mr James Barrow and they also constructed a
large number of coke ovens both at Maesteg and Ogmore Vale.
Messrs. Brogden and Sons were also largely interested in the Llynfi and Ogmore Railway Co., which developed the old tram road (along which coal
and iron ore used to be hauled from Maesteg to Tondu and Porthcawl) into a modern railroad.
In 1872 Messrs. Brogden and Sons formed the Llynfi, Tondu and Ogmore Coal and Iron Company, which acquired the ironworks established in 1826 at
Maesteg, where, by the way, the iron pillars used in the construction of the Bridgend Market in 1836 were manufactured.
The chairman of this company was Mr Alexander Brogden, M.P., a brother of Mr James Brogden.
Early in the seventies Mr James Brogden went to New Zealand to manage a large railroad contract which his firm had undertaken and he remained there for several years.
The Brogdens continued to be the most influential employers of labour in Mid Glamorgan until 1878 when a period of depression in the iron and coal
trade brought the Tondu and Maesteg works to a standstill and their connection with those districts came to a close, much to the regret of the community.
Mr James Brogden, during his residence at Tondu was very popular among all classes and especially with the numerous workpeople in the employ of his
company who regarded him as a generous employer and a courteous gentleman.
During the colliers' strike of 1873, Messrs. Brogden granted the demands of their men, severing their connection with the Colliery Owners'
Association in order that they might do so, a course which involved them in the payment of a heavy penalty.
Mr James Brogden took a great deal of interest in the Volunteer movement and when living at Tondu was an officer in the old 11th Glamorgans.
On his return from New Zealand, Mr Brogden took up his residence at Ferryside, Carmarthenshire and latterly at Porthcawl, where he owned
considerable property, including the Esplanade Hotel. Indeed the development of Porthcawl has been in a large measure due to the efforts of Mr Brogden,
who invested a great deal of money in various undertakings in the neighbourhood.
The Brogdens purchased the Hollier estate and constructed the Porthcawl Docks, which were transferred to the Great Western Railway Company
when the company purchased the Llynfi and Ogmore Railway.
Mr Brogden was one of the promoters of the Porthcawl Waterworks Co., and he also established an electric light undertaking, by which the
business portion of the town was lighted for many years. He constructed the old esplanade sea wall and expended large sums in other improvements in the neighbourhood.
He took a great deal of interest in the "Rest" Convalescent Home and was vice-president of the Porthcawl Golf Club to which he presented a handsome bowl for annual competition.
Mrs Brogden, his widow, is a descendant of General Sir Thomas Picton, of Poyston, Pembrokeshire, who commanded the "Fighting Division" in the Peninsular
War and fell at Waterloo leading his men to the charge. The deceased was an ardent musician, a member of the Geological Society and of the Royal
Geographical Society and in 1878 was president of the South Wales Engineers' Society.
He was a Justice of the Peace for the Newcastle and Ogmore Division.
The Funeral
The funeral, which took place on Monday afternoon, was of a semi-private character.
The body was conveyed by hearse to Newton Parish Church, the interment being made in the family grave. The remains were enclosed in an oak coffin,
with massive brass furniture and the name plate bore the inscription: "James Brogden, born April 7th, 1832, died January 26th, 1906."
The service in the church was conducted by the Rev. T. Holmes Morgan (Rector of Newton Nottage) who also performed the last sad rites at the graveside.
The chief mourners were Mrs Brogden (the widow), Miss Brogden (daughter), Mr Picton (brother-in-law). Others present included Drs. Hartland and W.B. Wooding,
the staff of the Esplanade Hotel, Messrs. W. Williams, Henry Thomas, W. House, T.L. Nicholls, T. Cook, M. Power, T. James, J. Coombs, Robert Elias, etc.
The floral tributes included a beautiful wreath from the agent and tenants of the Ferryside estate. The funeral arrangememts were in the hands of Mr
Leonard Rhys, Queen-street, Bridgend.

KENFIG HERITAGE - Community - Pubs, Inns & Alehouses (Pyle)
The Pyle Inn (An 18th Century Coaching Inn)
Crime & Punishment - History of Glamorgan Constabulary in 1841
Appointment of 1st Chief Constable for Glamorgan at the Pyle Inn
The appointment of the 1st Chief Constable for Glamorgan, Capt. Charles Napier was confirmed at Quarter Sessions at Pyle Inn on 11 August 1841.
Meeting at Pyle Inn
At the General Quarter Sessions of the Peace for the said County, held by adjournment at Pyle Inn, on Monday, the thirtienth day of August, 1841,
present John Nicholl, Esq, R. Franklen Esq, and Rev. R. Knight, the Chief Constable of the said County, appointed under the provisions of 2 and 3 Vic.,
cap.93, having made his report as follows:
To the Magistrates of the County of Glamorgan
GENTLEMEN
At an adjourned Sessions, held at Pyle, on the 11th of August, you conferred upon me the honorable appointment of Chief Constable of this County;
I beg to express my sincere acknowledgements and to assure you that my best engeries shall be devoted to maintain the high confidence you have reposed in me.
Having being honored with your instructions to make a tour of the county with a view of suggesting the requisite arranagements prior to the
adoption of the new system of police force, I beg to submit the following report as the result of my investigation:
The division of the county into four districts having been resolved upon, I first directed my attention to that point and am of opinion that the
arrangement of districts as proposed cannot be improved upon with the exception of Margam Parish, which I recommend to be included in the Swansea
District in order that the Aberavon Police Sonstable may extend his beat to Taibach, &c.;
In the event of the Borough Towns being incorporated with the new system, a considerable alteration of the Districts would of course be necessary.
To prevent any misunderstanding with regard to the Districts, I have drawn boundary lines and have prepared plans of each District which I now
submit for your approval. The plans will also show my proposed disposition of the Force and will obviate unnecassary recapitulation in my report.
I propose placing with each Superintendant a plan of his district and although I have arranged the disposition of the Force, circumstances will often
occur which may render it desirable to alter that arrangement and I am of opinion that certain discretionary powers should be vested in the Superintendant
to act as the emergency of the case may require.
In alloting to each Constable his portion of the District, I have been guided by the character and extent of the population and the most direct means of communication.
I propose that the Force be divided into three classes viz - Sergeant or First Class, at 22s.; Second Class, at 20s.; Third Class, at 18s.; the number would be
Sergeants, Eleven; Second Class, Eleven and Third Class, Twelve; by this means no additional expence will be incurred and a sort of emulation and Espirit de
Corps created which will tend materially to the efficiency of the Force.
MERTHYR DISTRICT
I propose that Merthyr be selected as the station for the Superintendant.
In a populous district such as Merthyr and Dowlais, I think it essential to the efficiency of the Force that the residence for the Police should be
provided in the Station-House, the immediate erection of which I would strongly recommend. I think a central site should be selected.
I have inspected the Cells at present in use at Merthyr and found them totally unfit for the recption of prisoners, indeed so much so, that the
Magistrates find it necessary to place Prisoners at Public-houses, in charge of a Constable, at a considerable additional expence to the county. I think a
Lock-up-house at Aberdare would be advisable, as the Petty Sessions are held there.
On proceeding to Rumney, I, observed, that, although a considerable portion of the Works are in the County of Glamorgan, the main body of the
Inhabitants are located in the County of Monmouth, I think some arrangement might be entered into to enable the Constable to act on the Monmouthshire side of the River.
NEWBRIDGE DISTRICT
I find that Llantrisant is at present the residence of the Superintendant, but that town being situate near the boundary of the District,
I am strongly of opinion that Newbridge shuold be the Station for the Superintendant. Newbridge is nearly the centre of the Distict and from its
proximity to the Taff Vale Railway, commands advantages not possessed by Llantrisant.
In erecting a Station-House, I would advise that apartments be provided for the Constable there stationed, with Three Cells for Prisoners.
At present there is no Lock-up-house at this place. I consisder Cells necessary for the security of Prsioners, as there is considerable risk in
the present method of confining them at the private dwelling of the Constable.
I would recommend the erection of suitable Lock-up-houses at Llantrisant and Caerphilly - the present Cells at those places are the worst possible description.
Llandaff being in the vicinity of Cardiff would not require a Lock-up-house.
OGMORE DISTRICT
I propose making Bridgend the Station for this District and the residence of the Superintendant.
By placing myself at Cowbridge, I consider that the duty of this extensive district would be more effectively performed. The smallness of the Force
allotted to this district precludes my filling up Stations where I think Constables could be placed with advantage. Bridgend being the central point,
it is highly desirable that a good Station-House should be erected, I would suggest that the building should contain a residence for the Constable,
with office for the Superintendant and four cells.
The Cells at Cowbridge will be available, but, it will be necessary to make some arrangement for warming them in winter.
At Lantwit Major an additional Cell is required for which the present site affords ample facility at a trifling cost.
SWANSEA DISTRICT
I think Pontardawe the most central part for the residence of the Superintendant. The Force allotted to this District, I consider small.
I have placed the Constables where crime is most to be apprehended; and to the apparent neglect of the Western Agricultural portion of the District,
to which, I should have assigned another Constable had the number permitted. On visiting Ystradgunlais my attention was drawn to the Twrch Valley,
where are located a considerable population, reported to be of lawless character.
I should suggest that an arrangement should be entered into with the Magistrates of the County of Brecon, in order that the whole
Vale of the Twrch may be under the charge of the Constable stationed in that quarter - the Couty boundary affording facilities for the escape of delinquents.
I would also submit that Sessions should be held alternately in Brecon amd Glamorgan, in the neighbourhood of Ystradgunlais.
The only Lock-up-houses in the District, are at Aberavon and Cwmavon, which have been erected by private subscription and I have no doubt would be
given over for the purpose of the Force. With slight alteration, the above Lock-up-houses can be made available. I would recommend that a suitable
Station-House be erected at Pontardawe.
I find that there is a Police Force established along the line of the Swansea Canal, who are paid by the Committee of Traders.
I think it highly desirable that this Force should cooperate with the men under my charge and by so doing, a mutual advantage would be derived.
I would recommend that Constables residing at Station Houses should pay rent, on a scale in proportion to their pay.
In the course of my tour, I endeavoured to ascertain whether any buildings could be rented, which might, at a small expence, be made available
for Station House; I did not meet with any, which, in my opinion, could be rented with advantage to the County. It is of the utmost importance to the
successful operation of the system, that good and efficient men should be appointed to the duties of the Constabulary and in order to enable me to
select proper persons, I beg the favour of as much time being granted me as the County arrangement will permit.
I have the honour to be,
Gentlemen,
Your most obedient Servant,
C.F. Napier.
ORDERED, that such Report be received and printed, and that the Clerk of Peace give due Notice for the consideration thereof at the next Sessions.
That the Rules proposed at the adjourned Sessions for the said County, 11th August, 1841, for the Payment and Application of Fees, under the
powers of the several Acts relating to the County Constabulary be adopted.
That a Police Rate of Â£800 be raised within the several Districts of the County for the purpose of the Police.
By the Court,
WOOD
Clerk of the Peace.

RAF Stormy Down Hinterland
The Royal Air Force aerodrome on Stormy Down served a very important role in the training of both air and ground crews during the Second World War.
The initial base was located at Stormy Down with a subsidiary Air-Sea Rescue Unit located in Porthcawl (Jennings Building, Porthcawl Harbour) -
its Hinterland stretched from the river mouth at Ogmore-by-sea in the east to the Kenfig river mouth in the west.
RAF Stormy Down served the entire Kenfig and surrounding areas throughout WWII where the Kenfig Sands were used for training purposes for both air & ground manoeuvres
and Porthcawl harbour as an Air-Sea Rescue facility.
The new Kenfig website will provide a comprehensive listing of the entire base and Hinterland of RAF Stormy Down to include the Training Ranges
(Margam Air-to-Ground & Margam Air-Air)(Air-Air Tow Lines at Kenfig & Ogmore-by-Sea), Overspill Accommodation Sites at Porthcawl, Stormy Down Defences

The Harbour Inn (Ye Pirates Club, The Square, Porthcawl)
A group of local landowners and businessmen obtained an Act of Parliament to construct a dock at Porthcawl in 1825. When works on the first
dock started in Porthcawl in 1828 so did the arrival of the town's first public houses. Many of these were converted dwellings in the vicinity of
the harbour which served the workers employed in the construction of the dock complex.
One of the very first of these hostelries was the Harbour Inn. Porthcawl Docks prospered and became a leading exporter for the coal & iron
industries. In 1928, the Pirate's Club was founded and still uses the old Harbour Inn premises.

KENFIG HERITAGE - EDUCATION
33 Years in Same School - Cornelly Schoolmaster Retires
After 33 years as headmaster of the Cornelly mixed schools, Mr Thomas Penhale has tendered his resignation to the managers of the Bridgend Group of Schools.
Mr Penhale was born in 1845 in Crowan near Camborne, Cornwall. After a five years' apprenticeship as pupil teacher in his native village he was
successful in obtaining an assistantship at Llanidloes National Schools in 1865. At the end of the following year he became assistant at Bryndu School, Kenfig Hill.
He remained here for three years and then proceeded to the Llanddarog National School near Carmarthen as headmaster. Four years later he became headmaster
of the Llangennech National Schools and during a stay of five years in which he worked very hard, he was successful in raising the standard of efficiency
to such a pitch as to merit special mention in the Education Blue Books as one of the best in the country.
In 1877 Mr and Mrs Penhale were appointed master and mistress respectively of the Cornelly Mixed Schools and this position Mr Penhale has held ever since.
Mrs Penhale resigned soon after her appointment owing to failing health. Soon after settling in the parish Mr Penhale took an active interest in public affairs.
He was elected a member of the first Parish Council in 1894 and with only one break has kept the position, acting as the Council's chairman.
Mr Penhale has represented the parish of Pyle on the Penybont Rural District Council and Board of Guardians. He has paid much attention to the educational
and other endowments of the parish and it is mainly through his efforts the Board of Education formulated the scheme wherby the funds of the Morgan's Educational
Foundation have been utilised in providing scholarships for the children of Pyle and Kenfig at the Bridgend County School.
On retirement Mr Penhale intends residing at Porthcawl.

This public house located in North Cornelly closed its doors in May 2014 after being privately purchased from a brewery. In it's present state (as of 26 February 2016) it
remains empty and boarded up with no certainty of re-opening for business nor for private residence. There maybe a legal covenant on the deeds of the Cornelly Arms
property stating that if it is demolished any new building has to be re-built on the extisting foundations of the present building.
Here's a little background history
about the Cornelly Arms being a lodge of the Philanthropic Order of True Ivorites Society during the 19th century and its possible association with the father and son
responsible for the Welsh National Anthem. It appears quite ironic that the name of the Cornelly Arms Lodge was named "Ap Iago Lodge" which happens to be same as the bardic name used by both father & son
responsible for the National Anthem themselves.
Background Heritage
During the latter part of the 19th century, the Cornelly Arms was a lodge (Ap Iago Lodge) of the Philanthropic Order of True Ivorites Society in Cornelly.
Central Glamorgan Gazette - Ivorites Anniversary
On Saturday the 23rd, inst, the Llewwellyn ap Ivor Lodge of the True Ivorites held their anniversary at the Prince of Wales.
The members met at their lodge room at half past three in the afternoon and forming in a procession started out at four o'clock and
marched to Cornelly, on their way down visiting a monument at Cornelly Chapel which the Llewellyn ap Ivor Lodge had put up in commemoration
of their late secretary, Mr Issac Williams.
The procession then visited the lodge room of the Ap Iago Lodge at the Cornelly Arms, when Mr J. Jenkins and Mr J. Thomas were voted to the chair.
Several addressed were delivered by the members including a poetical address by cynfflgwyson. After each one had partaken of a
glass of "cwrw da" the procession marched up to the lodge room at the Prince of Wales where an excellent supper was ready on the table.

The Philanthropic Order of True Ivorites
Referred to as the Ivorites Society or The Ivorites was a friendly society founded in Wrexham in 1836.
Kenfig and Cornelly had lodges of the Ivorites which were held at the Prince of Wales, Kenfig (Llewwellyn ap Ivor Lodge) &
the Cornelly Arms (Ap Iago Lodge) respectively.
This friendly society conducted its business exclusively in Welsh. As well as helping the poor the order promoted the Welsh Language
through organising local Eistedfoddau.
The Laws & Regulations of the order were published in 1839 and states that the True Ivorites Society is
an institution to encourage the Welsh language and to preserve its members as far as possible from want.
The Ivorites, along with fellow society the Oddfellows, were especially strong in Glamorgan and survived well into the 20th century.
The societies were often a substitute for Trade Unions but were never a threat to the Union's existence (the Unions grew out of the activities of the Friendly Societies).
The Ivorites was not a secret society but did have its own handsigns & handshakes.
The Welsh National Anthem
Evan James (1809-1878) also known by the bardic name "Ieuan ap Iago" was famous for writing the lyrics of Hen Wlad fy Nhadau,
the national anthem of Wales. The music was written by his son, James James (Iago ap Ieuan).
Evan James was himself involved with the Ivorite Society at Pontypridd Gorsedd (meeting of the bards) which was first organised
by Edward Williams (bardic name: Iolo Morgannwg).
Evan James (1809-1878)
Evan James was a modest tradesman living in Pontypridd during the mid 19th century. He was born in Caerphilly in 1809, a weaver
by trade who would spend his spare time reading literature and composing simple poetry.
From a young age he showed an interest in music and was fond of the harp.
Evan went under the bardic name of Ieuan ap Iago.

KENFIG HERITAGE - COMING SOON ON OUR NEW WEBSITE
A new Section will be introduced into Kenfig - The Complete History (e-Resource) for many reasons over the coming months
entitled "History of the Vale of Glamorgan" here is a brief example of what's in store...
History of the Vale of Glamorgan
The Landed Gentry: The Merthyr Mawr Estate
Merthyrmawr House (Its fine situation, history & associations)
Within a few miles radius of the thriving market town of Bridgend there are many notable mansions and places of interest to the antiquary,
historian and tourist. Among these may be noted Merthyrmawr, the home of Mr John Iltyd Dillwyn Nicholl, D.L., J.P. The mansion occupies a finely
diversified situation a couple of miles south-west of Bridgend in the centre of one of the most engrossing sites of Morganwg.
Perhaps it would be somewhat difficult to find in the whole county of Glamorgan a district which presents such a number of varied attractions as that of which Merthyrmawr is the centre.
Its antiquarian interests are legion and the varied scenery includes bracing uplands, wooded slopes, smiling fields, picturesque rivers, and sand dunes;
and near by is a charming, romantic coastline. To the botanist or lover of plants, it is remarkable for the variety of its flora, and to the zoologist its
fannu is a source of continual fascinating interest and delight.
Let us pause for a moment its interesting antiquarian features. Only about a mile distant across the sandhills you may find, in the shape of
stone hammers and arrow heads, bronze daggers and other various implements, old relics of the Neolithic and Bronze Ages, representing the ancient past.
There are also Cromlechs which had probably been standing there about a thousand years when Rome was founded. Just below, on the sandhills near Candleston
Castle (now in ruins) have been found several Roman coins, which are conclusive evidence of the Roman occupation ages ago.
Within the ancient Parish Churchyard at Merthymawr are some early Christian crosses, dating back to the fifth century and just behind Merthyrmawr mansion,
on the little wooded knoll or hill, there stands a small group of very ancient crosses, of which the largest, called the Great Goblin Stone, is said to be of seventh century origin.
Near the banks of the Ogmore River may be seen the ruins of Ogmore Castle, which Sir William de Londres erected in Norman times and only just a long mile
away across the pretty valley is Ewenny Priory, which was founded by Maurice de Londres, who lies buried in the south trancept of the ancient Abbey at Ewweny.
Candleston Castle (in ruins), which is only about a mile away, on the verge of civilisation where the verdant and fertile fields and the huge
sandhills meet, dates from the latter part of the 14th century or early 15th century and post-medieval relics include the fishing weirs on the Ewenny
river; and in the Parish Churchyard at Merthyrmawr is an ancient sun-dial, which formerly occupied a position over the south porch of the old
village church, with its Latin inscription: "Transit hora sine mora," and bears the inscribed date, A.D. 1720.
Finally, there is the present stately mansion of Merthyrmawr, which was erected in the year 1804, which forms the subject of the present article.
Few districts in the county of Glamorgan, or in the Principality of Wales can probably produce such a fine and wonderful sequence of archaeological
relics and every one of those enumerated is within a radius of about a mile and a half from the mansion at Merthyrmawr.
And, again, to these interests must be added the romance which the old folk-tales and traditions have cast over the surrounding district ages ago.
It is interesting to note that about a century ago the great massive Goblin Stone was drawn in Car-llys, pulled by six oxen, from its old site or
position where it had lain for centuries in the Cae'r Groes and placed in its present position in the picturesque grounds of Merthyrmawr House.
There are still a few old inhabitants at Merthyrmawr village and district who have heard from their parents fireside tales of "the fearsome goblings"
which over nights used to haunt the field at Cae'r Groes, in which the Goblin Stone formerly stood before its removal.
With so many memorials of ancient days attracting the eye and facing one at every turn, we cannot be surprised or think it strange, indeed, if
such superstitious fairy tales did survive, as the very atmosphere is suggestive and redolent of old time.
Then, again, there are the wonders of nature all around, which arouse in the dweller of active mind a sense of the mysterious. For instance,
there are the numerous caverns in mountain limestone outcrop - vast chasms or wide openings, in which you may hear the rushing water dashing far
below you and the silent but relentless in-roads of the sand around the mouth of the Ogmore River pressing onward, ever onward, covering trees and
dwelling houses in its destructive course in the wake of time.

SITUATION OF MERTHYRMAWR HOUSE
Proceeding from Bridgend, the roadway runs parallel to the Ogmore river and on the eastern side. it is an easy, gentle gradient until you
arrive at the cross-roads, where a sharp turn to the right takes you down a steep descent on the road leading you to the old New Inn Bridge,
of which more anon.
Just over the bridge, on the left-hand, is the Lodge gate and proceeding from here a pretty drive, half a mile in length,
skirts the right bank of the Ogmore River and gradually winds up the hill between the stately trees to the mansion which is magnificently
situated on the south-eastern slope of the hill and commanding a fine, magnificent view across the Ogmore and Ewennt rivers with the hills, etc., beyond in the distance.
The mansion is beautifully set about three hundred yards up on the hillside above the roadway leading from Bridgend to Merthyrmawr Village and Candleston
Castle and is backed with luxurious plantations of trees. Although the mansion was designed in an age which was not famed for architectural grace or beauty,
it would be idle to deny that its external appearance is adapted and suited to its position. As seen from the roadway below, it at once conveys the idea of
solidity, cosiness and comfort rather than that of elegance but the pretty shaded creepers which cover andadorn much of its main front and its delicious
surrounding sylvan scenery, help to soften its outline and create a most pleasing effect to the eye.
MERTHYRMAWR IN THE 16TH & 18TH CENTURIES
Before speaking further of the present mansion, let us digress for a few moments and have a peep into the past history of Merthyrmawr.
From Leland's "Itinerary in Wales," about A.D. 1530-36, I quote the following particulars:
"Merthyrmawr, Mr Stradling's place, is a fair manor place of stone. It standith on the west side, ripe about a mile above Ogmore river mouth."
MEMOIRS OF THE NICHOLL FAMILY
Most of the land, if not all, now comprised by the Merthyrmawr Estate was for some centuries in the possession of the celebrated Stradling
family, St. Donat's Castle; but we find that in 1738 Sir Thomas Stradling, of St.Donat's Castle, the last of the Stradlings, was killed in a duel at Montpelier, France and left no heir or issue.
Subsequently, after a long series of law suits, the estates were ultimately divided by an Act of Parliament between the families of Tyrrwhitt, Drake, Mansel and Bowen.
To the Bowen family fell Monknash and Merthyrmawr Estates and we shall presently perceive how and when the estate passed to the Nicholl family.
Merthyrmawr Estate, comprising nearly 5,000 acres of land, passed by purchase into the hands of the Right Hon. John Nicholl more than a century ago; or, to be
precise, it should be stated that the purchase was completed just before 1804 and previous to that period the mansion or manor house stood on the site now
occupied by the Home Farmhouse, near the village of Merthyrmawr.
Eventually, Sir John Nicholl, finding the old "Stradling-Bowen" mansion not congenial and suited to his own particular requirements, built the present
fine and spacious mansion, which today is the home of his great-grandson, Mr John I.D. Nicholl, J.P. A few facts now concerning the family of the present owner will be of interest.
The Nicholl family were seated for several generations at Llantwit Major and we find that that as far back as the reign of Henry VIII (1509-1547), one Iltyd Nicholl was a chirugeon.
The old home of the Nicholl family was at the Great House, Llantwit Major which is still standing toady in a fair state of preservation and later we find that
several braches of the Nicholl family established their homes at The Ham, Llantwit Major and also at Llanmaes House, in the village of Llanmaes. The Nicholl
family of Merthyrmawr were an off-shoot or branch of the Nicholl family at The Ham, Llantwit Major.
The Right Hon. Sir John Nicholl, D.C.L., M.P., was a son of Mr John Nicholl who was the third son of Mr Iltyd Nicholl of The Ham, Llantwit Major.
Sir John Nicholl was born at Llanmaes House, 16th March 1759 and lived to see the ascension of Queen Victoria to the Throne of England, 22nd June 1837.
He was a very distinguished, learned man and was dean of the Arches and Judge of the Prerogative Court. After his death he was succeeded by his son and heir,
the Right Hon. John Nicholl, M.P., who represented Cardiff in the Conservative interest from 13th December, 1832 to July 1852 when he was defeated by the late
Mr Walter Coffin, his Liberal opponent, by 26 votes.
Sir John Nicholl was appointed Judge Advocate General in the year 1841. He married a Miss Talbot of Margam park and by her had a family of six children
of whom the eldest son and heir, Mr John Cole Nicholl, succeeded to the Merthyrmawr Estates on the death of his father in the year 1853.
Merthyrmawr House - To Be Continued...
NOTE: The First World War around Kenfig documents the history of the area at that point in time; the Nicholl family were involved with public administration, namely: The Penybont Rural District Council during this time, therefore a background history of the Nicholl family & Merthyrmawr is to be included.
KENFIG HERITAGE - MARGAM ABBEY (AD 1147-1536)
Virtual Library of Clairvaux (National Library of France)
Founded in 1147 by Robert, Earl of Gloucester, Margam Abbey was a Cistercian Abbey of the Mother House Clairvaux - its dissolution came about in 1536
and was the first abbey to fall under the Dissolution of the Monastries by King Henry VIII.
As Margam Abbey was a Cistercian Abbey of the Mother House Clairvaux & thanks to the National Library of France, Paris - The Virtual Library of Clairvaux
(with its 1,150 manuscripts) has been made available online to view. This should provide an in invaluable online resource for writers & researchers on the history of the monastic life of
Clairvaux in France and its connections with Margam Abbey and in-directly the Kenfig & surrounding areas.
Library of Clairvaux
With a remaining collection of 1450 manuscripts to which are added 400 incunabula & printed documents dating from the 15th century, the collection from Clairvaux
is the 1st known French Medieval collection. The Abbey of Clairvaux was established in 1115 AD by Bernard de Fontaines. The abbot of Citeaux entrusted Bernard with
the mission to establish a new abbey - he settled in the valley of Absinthe on the left side of the river Aube.
New buildings were built to welcome more numerous novices and this place became a well-known monastic centre of the Christendom. By the end of the Middle Ages,
another 530 other abbeys were established all over Europe.
From the initial foundation of the abbey, books are omnipresent as monastic life was not possible without them. The minimum required for a foundation was to
own the liturgical books as well as the Rules of Saint Benoit. From 1140 AD the library of Clairvaux became a rich place which held the attention of men of letters
in search or rare texts. By the end of the 12th century the library had a number of volumes of between 300 & 350 items.
The classification by Unesco recognizes the international interest & the exceptional worldwide character of the preserved collection.

The Charge of Murder at Kenfig Hill
Trial of two men for death of watchman at Bryndu Works, Kenfig Hill in 1878
Sentence of 20 years' Penal Servitude
At the Glamorgan Assizes on Wednesday before Justice Mellor, Thomas Morris, 22, collier; David Evans, 22, collier; Lewis Thomas, 18, tin worker were
indicted for that they feloniousy, wilfully and of malice aforethought did kill and murder Morgan Evans at Kenfig Hill on the 12th February.
Mr Allen and Mr Franklin appeared for the prosecution.
Mr Bowen Rowlands (instructed by Mr Howell Thomas) and Mr Abel Thomas appeared for Lewis Thomas; the prisoners Morris and Evans being defended by Mr Brynmor Jones.
In opening the case Mr Allen put the circumstances thereof before the jury.
About three o'clock on Sunday, the day in question, the deceased, who was the watchman and overlooker at the Bryndu works and 61 years of age,
went to the coke ovens and in the course of ten minutes or a quarter of an hour he received mortal injuries.
The prisoners, at the time, were seen in the field close by with dogs and men were directed by Mr Daniels, the manager of the works to pursue tem.
The engineman saw them pass and heard Lewis Thomas say to David Evans, in Welsh, "That was a devil of a slip." Immediately afterwards the deceased
came from the direction of the coke ovens.
He was bleeding profusely from wounds in the head; he pointed to two men in the field and David Thomas, with a man named Heatley ran after them a
distance of 700 or 800 yards. The men were Thomas Morris and David Evans.
Asked what they had been doing to the deceased, they said, "What the devil odds is it to you. We will serve you the same." David Evans pulled a knife
from his pocket, gave it to Morris and told him to "rip their guts out."
Deceased told people that he had been badly beated by three men and kicked in the side.
Before he was attacked, the three prisoners were seen together in the Crown public house.
They were apprehended by Police constable Rees, who also apprehended David Davies, a collier, aged 22, but the grand jury threw out
the bill against him. Lewis Thomas afterwards told Sergeant Lewis that he did not beat the deceased but that it was Evans and Morris.
David Evans said, "We gave the old man a bit of a thrashing, but I did not think he would die." Morris also said that he struck him a blow
or two, but he (the deceased) gave him a blow first and that was how the row begun.
David Davies deposed that he saw the deceased go in the direction of the coke ovens and soon after he heard him crying out "murder."
He went to the spot and saw the prisoner David Evans in the act of throwing a piece of coke, which struck him on the head. He also threw a
half brick at him, which struck him on the side, jumped before the old man and made fun of him.
Blood was running down the face of the deceased who made his way to the side of the ovens. David Evans followed him, rose his stick and struck
him across the shoulders. He then turned round and with his stick tried to keep Evans off.
The latter, however, rushed at him, threw him down on the ground and beat him severly.
Thomas Morris also beat him as he lay there.
While this was going on Thomas held the dogs which prisoners had with them and witness did not see him strike the deceased. Afterwards
Evans said to the deceased, "Behave, you old b-----, or else you shall have more."
Bryndu (Cefn) Iron Works c.1900
Asked by the judge why he did not interfere the witness said he did not think anything serious would follow.
His Lordship: All that I can say is that your conduct was very disgraceful.
Witness, continuing said the prisoners left the deceased lying on the ground. He tried to get up but at first he was only able to rise on his
knees and then fell back helpless. In the course of a few minutes he got better and proceeded to walk towards home but he rested several times on
the way owing to his exhausted condition.
Cross-examined by Mr Abel Thomas, witness said he believed that if the prisoner Thomas had not held the two dogs they would have attacked the
deceased and, in reply to Mr Jones, he said he thought it was only a fight between the two prisoners and the deceased.
Drs J.C. Pritchard and Llewellyn gave evidence as to the wounds on the head and face of deceased. One of the ribs was fractured and
this resulted in injury to the lungs causing difficulty in breathing.
On the conclusion of the case for the prosection, his Lordship expressed an opinion that there was no case as against Thomas to go to the jury.
The other witnesses called for the prosection were Mary Evans, Richard Evans, son of the deceased, Benjamin Daniels, manager of the Bryndu Works,
John Davies, engineman, David Thomas, David Lewis and David Davies.
No witnesses were called for the defence.
Mr B. Jones then addressed the jury on behalf of Evans and Morris.
He pointed to the absence of deliberation, of concerted action, or malice towards the deceased on the part of the accused and in the absence of any motive,
he thought the jury would consider long before finding a verdict of murder against these two men.
He asked them to dismiss from their minds that which Mr Allen had mentioned regarding the deceased having previously given evidence against a relation of one of the accused.
In all probability there was provocation given and therefore he contended that the crime was reduced to one of manslaughter.
The Judge having elaborately summed up and complimented Mr B. Jones on his address.
The jury retired and after consulting for three quarters of an hour, returned with a verdict of manslaughter against Morris and Evans, Thomas was found not guilty.
His Lordship, addressing the prisoners said they had been convicted upon evidence of the most conclusive and satisfactory character, of the crime of manslaughter.
He throughly agreed with the finding of the jury and he did not think he should be doing his duty in a case where it was clearly proved that two men
wantonly and brutally attacked an old man of 61 if he did not pass such a sentence as would deter other violent and heedless persons as the prisoners from similar crimes.
The sentence he would pass upon them, therefore would be 20 years' penal servitude.
Thomas was discharged.

Mr William FosterJohn, Kenfig Hill (1864-1935)
The following is a story of a Kenfig Hill man who became the Second Manager & Sub-Missionary of the Buenos Aires Sailors' Home and Mission in
South America in 1894. There's also a brief background of this British Institution that was founded in 1885 along with a truly remarkable story of
the gentleman's life kindly provided by his Great Grandson, Mr Andy FosterJohn of Kenfig Hill.
Success of a Kenfig Hill boy in South America
Mr Foster John of Kenfig Hill, who went out to Argentine four years ago has been appointed Manager and Sub-Missionary of the Buenos Ayres Sailors' Home and
Mission out of a large number of applicants.
This has necessitated Mr John's departure from Campania where he has taken an active part in Band of Hope and Sunday School Work and at a recent
concert there, occasion was taken to make him a presentation.
The Buenos Ayres Herald gives the following account of the event:
A pleasant break was here made in the programme by the President, Mr H. Martin who said that he availed himself of that opportunity to introduce an
unrehearsed piece, a piece in which they were all interested, and one to which they were looking forward - but the person most interested in it was entirely ignorant.
The piece he referred to was the leather writing case which they saw he was carrying in his hand and the person was Mr Wm. Foster John whom he was glad to see amongst
them once more, though it was only for two days.
He was glad of this opportunity of publicly presenting him with a small token of the affection and esteem in which he had always been held by them during the four
years in which he had been associated with them in Campania before he was called away to take the management of the Sailors' Home, Buenos Ayres.
Mr Martin then read a short address to Mr Foster John, concluding by calling upon him to come forward and accept the gift in the name of the Campania Band of Hope
and Sunday School.
Mr Foster John though taken completely by surprise by this to him, unexpected mark of esteem from his Campania friends, stepped upon the platform and replied
in a few appropriate and well turned sentences, at the conclusion of which he was heartily applauded.
Extract from: Glamorgan Gazette - Friday April 27, 1894
The Buenos Ayres Sailors' Home & Harbour Mission
Habitated in the Victoria Sailors' Home was like many other British Institutions - The Buenos Aryes Sailors' Home had its origin in 'small things'.
Antiguo HÃ´tel de InmigrantesÂBuenos Aires, c. 1900
In 1885, a small group of religious men started a regular Sunday afternoon service for the seamen whose ships were lying in the Boca. A few years later,
Mr James McGowan began an agitation through the English press for something more tangible.
As a result of the interst aroused, the Revs. J.W. Fleming, Pelham Ogle, and J.H. Stockton met at the home of the last-named gentleman to see what could be done.
It was resolved, that as Mr Fleming was about to leave on vacation, he should visit the Rev. E.W. Mathhews, of the British and Foreign Sailors' Friendly
Society of London, and lay the facts before the society. The result of this was a visit to this city by Mr Matthews. Many of the senior businessmen
still remember how this white-haired veteran hustled round the city pleading the cause of the sailors.
At the instigation of Mr Matthews, a public meeting was called on Friday June 2nd at the La France Hall.
The chair was taken by H.B.M. Minister the Hon. Francis Pakenham. At that meeting the first Sailors' Home Committee was appointed which consisted of the
following gentlemen: Mr T.S. Boadle, Chairman; Rev. J.W. Fleming, Secretary; Don Juan Drysdale, Treasurer; Revs. Pelham Ogle, J.H. Stockton; Messrs.
Ronald Bridgett, H.B.M. Consul; S.A. Christopherson, Swedish & Norwegian Consul; P. Christopherson, Danish Consul; E.L. Baker, USA Consul; C. Ferrio,
German Consul; L.Van Riet, Dutch Minister; C. Marriott VVoodgate and W. Higgins.
This committee issued an appeal for funds with the result that $491.42 gold and $17,200.65 paper was raised.
This encouraged, the Committee rented premises situated in Calle Pedro Mendoz.i, corner of La Madrid, in the Boca, and on Monday January 26th 1891,
opened to the seamen of the world the international, interdenominational Buenos Aires Sailors' Home.
At the opening ceremony Mr T.S. Boadle presided, the Rev. J.W. Fleming read the committee's report and Mr E.E. Cordner moved the adoption of the same.
The first Missionary-Manager of the Home was Mr P.J. Walker who served till 1893, when Mr Foster John took charge.
He was followed by Mr G. Chamberlain in 1898 who resigned in 1901 when Mr Henry F. Fellows was appointed.
From the foundation of the work the Committee had always seen the absolute necessity of possessing their own building. In 1895 they petitioned
Congress for land on which to build. Owing chiefly to the work of Rear-Admiral Howard and Seftor Ricardo Pillado, the Sailors' Home Land Committee
and the earnes advocating through the press of Mr E.T. Mulhall, the land on which the Victoria Sailors' Home now stands was granted. In the whole
stretch of shipping a more suitable spot could not be found.
The year 1897 was the most fruitful on record for philanthropic work. In that year illustrious Victoria completed her sixieth year as Queen.
The Britishers of the River Plate met to discuss how that year could be perpetuated.
At an adjourned meeting held at Prince George's Hall on May 6th the following resolution was unanimously agreed to:
"That as a permanent memorial of the auspicious event, a Sailors' Home for the Port of Beunos Aires be built."
A committee was appointed to carry out this resolution consisting of the following gentlemen:The Hon. W.A.C. Barrington (Sir W.A.C. Barrington,
K.C.M.G); Rev. J.W. Fleming, B.D.; Messrs A. Mackintosh, J.C. Zimmerman, R.O. Watson, J.F. Roberts, T.S. Boadle.
To this number were added at different times:
Messrs R. Inglis Runciman, H.C. Thompson, John Russell, T.M. Mills, Wm Mulhall, Juan Drysdale, Wm Warden, John Dunn, Patrick Ham, Ronald Bridgett,
F. Barrow, C.W. Mills and E.A. Merry.
Although it was five years from the above date the Victoria Home was opened to Sailors, the Chairman, Secretary, Treasurer Sir W.A.C.
Barrington, Rev. J.W. Fleming and Mr R. Inglis Runciman respectively retained their position untl they had the pleasure of seeing their work successfully accomplished.
The building as it now stands cost some $80,000. It was opened by President Roca on April 16th 1902.
Not the least interesting part of the programme being the unveiling of a magnificent portrait of Her Majesty, the late Queen Victoria,
a gift from Her Majesty to the Victoria Sailors' Home through the British and Foreign Sailors' Friend Society.
Needless to say, since the opening of the new building the work of the B.A. Sailors' Home and Mission has increased tenfold. Concerts
and Socials which are now so popular with the Seamen, originated with the new Home. Every night since its opening the bed-space has been
taxed to the utmost. The number of Seamen who have boarded there until a berth has been procured has considerably increased.
The religious side of the work has also benefited.
To such an extent is this the case that it is doubtful if a better attended or heartier English Service could be found in the City than the Sunday
Evening Service at the Home. The Home publication, Fore and Aft, a readible, chatty paper of 20 pages, performs a useful mission. The annual Seamen's Picnic is a great feature.
Last New Year's day no less than 1400 Seamen spent the whole day in the country. The following figures give some idea of the work of the Home.
Since the Home was founded until May 1st 1909, some 17,000 men have entered as paying boarders. For the vast majority of these employment has been found.
Since the inauguration of the present Home 48,000 free meals and 13,600 free beds have been given to aged and decent Seamen. The Home is visited by some
2000 Seamen every month. Thousands of books are collected and distributed.
Yet withal the Home is still able to carry out the ideal of the present Management, that any genuine Seaman of any Nationality or Creed in
need of a helping hand will most surely find one, at any hour of the day or night.
The address of the Sailors' Home or to give its official name, "The Buenos Aires Sailors' Home and Mission" is called Independencia 20, between Docks 1 & 2.

William John:
Kenfig Hill Boy Goes To South America.
My Great Grandfather, was born William John, in Kenfig Hill in 1864 and died William Fosterjohn in Nottingham in 1935. He had a few adventures
in between, not least, changing his surname.
William Fosterjohn, seated right, arms folded
William was born in Kenfig Hill, in the parish of Tythgeston on 16th September 1864, to parents William and Catherine John, both born in Pyle.
William John senior was a grocer and draper, and Senior Deacon of the Moriah Calvanistic Methodist Chapel in Kenfig Hill. Catherine's maiden name was also John.
Queen Victoria was on the throne, the American Civil War was in full flow, and overarm bowling had just been legalized in cricket.
A sixteen year old William John junior was listed in the 1881 census as a pupil teacher, and went on to become a school teacher, his last known
appointment being at Glyncorrwg, where he lodged with his elder sister, Jane and her husband, at number 1, Cavell Street.
The 1881 census also shows that William had at least four siblings; Jane, Evan, Mary and Jenkin.
As a young man, William fell out with his Father, either over religion, or his further education, and subsequently emigrated to South America at the age of 25,
with the intention of becoming a missionary among the indigenous tribes. The passenger list of the ship he sailed on in 1890, listed his occupation as a farmer,
rather than teacher.
Initially, as reported in the Glamorgan Gazette, he worked for the Campania Band of Hope and Sunday School. The Band of Hope was a Methodist temperance
organisation, devoted to teaching children and young people the 'evils of drink.' Campana was a small port town, north west of Buenos Aires, and in the
early 1890s would have been a fairly rough and ready place. Campania was a region in Italy, which which many of the original inhabitants of the town came.
He then moved to Buenos Aires and in 1893 found work as a Missionary-Manager at the Seaman's Mission, where he stayed for five years. In Buenos Aires he met
and married Daisy Gibbs, whose family had emigrated to Argentina from Southampton. They married at St. AndrewÂs Scots Presbyterian Church in September 1894
and lived at The Seaman's Mission, 791 Pedro Mendoza, Boca, Buenos Aires. This was right on the dockside, and would have been a busy and bustling place at
that time. It's now a six lane highway.
The Glamorgan Gazette of April 1894, refers to William as Mr Foster John. When he got married in September of that year, his name was listed
as William Fosterjohn. The report on the setting up of the Seaman's Mission during the 1880s and 1890s, in Mitchell's Standard Guide to Buenos Aires,
published in 1909, also lists him as Mr Fosterjohn.
Their first child was born in Buenos Aires, but in 1898 the family moved to neighbouring Paraguay, where they had three more children, including my
Dad's Father Cyril. My Dad always told my brother and I that we were eligible to play football for Paraguay. In Paraguay William Fosterjohn worked as a
missionary with the indigenous Lengua peoples, of the Chaco region, but also acquired a large cattle ranch or estancia, with over 5,000 head of cattle.
In due course it was decided that the growing family should return to England, in order that the children could receive an education, as there was
little in the way of educational facilities in Paraguay at that time. The ranch was sold, realising a considerable sum of money. The family returned to
England on the TSS Rimutaka, from New Zealand, embarking from Montevideo, and landing in Plymouth in September 1903.
Initially the family settled in Plymouth, where one of Daisy's sisters, Clara, ran a hotel, and the family lodged there for a while, whilst
William sought business opportunities back in England. A fifth child born here died in infancy.
The Plymouth Museum has nearly 600 items from Central and South America, of which the 50-plus objects collected by William Fosterjohn,
from the Lengua people of Paraguay
between 1899 and 1903 are deemed to be of 'major importance', and are referred to as 'The William Fosterjohn Collection.'
Relatives state that William was eager to get into business at the earliest possible opportunity, and against the advice of his brother in law, he then
invested most of his capital in a laundry business in Derby, to where the family moved. Another child was born in Derby, but unfortunately the laundry did so
badly that within a few years the bulk of the family fortune was lost, and William had to sell up and move to Nottingham.
A newspaper business was established close to Nottingham City Centre, and after another false start, and a change of premises, this did eventually flourish,
and remained in the family for many decades. Eventually it was taken over by Herbert George Fosterjohn, one of William's sons, and my Dad's Uncle George, who
carried on the business until retirement.
n addition to the newspaper shop William Fosterjohn found employment with Boots the Chemist and subsequently was in change of the postal department
at Station Street, Boots' Nottingham head office. William's wife, Daisy took over the running of the newsagents.
William and Daisy had a further two children in Nottingham, making a grand total of nine.
William Fosterjohn died on 24 October 1935 and is buried in the family grave at Wilford Hill cemetery in Nottingham. Daisy Fosterjohn died on April 3 1949
and was buried with William. My Dad Gordon was born in 1929, the son of Cyril, William's eldest son, and as a child remembered his grandfather as being very
religious, strict and somewhat scary.
As a footnote, Leslie Fosterjohn, my great uncle, moved to Swansea in 1963, and in 1970, changed his surname back to John by Deed Poll, thus bringing the story full circle.

Religion throughout the Kenfig & Surrounding Areas
Methodist Revival (18th & early 19th century)
Relic of the Methodist Revival in Wales
During the latter half of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth centuries, when the Parish Churches were denied to the saintly pioneers of
Welsh Calvinistic Methodism in Wales and before they had even entertained the thought of erecting places of worship of their own, they were obliged to held
their religious services in cottages, farmhouses, barns, etc., and when an exceptional gathering was to be held (a 'Sassiwn' or 'Association'), the preaching
was generally in the open air as no building could be had at that time large enough to contain the number of people attending these gatherings from all parts
of the Principality.
At Longland farmhouse, which is situated about a mile and a half north-west of Pyle station on the G.W.R. and about 20 miles west of Cardiff,
is a most interesting relic of the dispensation of the itinerary evangelists in the shape of a pulpit chair, especially made for the servant's hall
of the above farmhouse at which place services were occasionally held for a great number of years.
The grandfather of the present occupier of Longland was a convert of Mr Howell Harris and from about the year 1775 he opened his house for the
meetings there for the people of the neighbourhood of Kenfig, Pyle and Margam.
The chair pulpit shown in the picture is the work of a local carpenter and is made from the best Welsh oak, the height of the back to suit the headroom of the hall.
The small chair for the preacher to stand on while preaching was made at the same time for that purpose, at a height which would enable the
preacher to see his audience and not too high so as to bring his head in contact with the stout beams under the loft.
Both these chairs were designed for the double purpose of religious and domestic use.
The Rev. Thomas Howell, who is seen standing on the low chair behind the pulpit is a minister of the Calvinistic Methodist connection.
He lives at Longland with his sister, Mrs Thomas, who is a widow and is seen sitting under the pulpit; she is the present tenant under Miss Talbot of Margam Park.
The open Bible on the pulpit is the first edition of the Rev. Peter Williams' Welsh Family Bible and Annotations, published 1770.
The hymn-book under Mr Howell's left hand is the first edition in a collective form by the Rev. William Williams of Pantycelyn, published 1811.
It is possible that both the Welsh commentator and hymnologist preached from this chair, as they are known to have often passed through this part
of Glamorganshire on their preaching tours; and John Williams, the son of the hymnologist, who was educated for the Church and served for the year 1781
as curate at Coychurch near Bridgend, but eventually went over to the Methodists.
Mr Evans of Llwynffortune, preached here after he was dismissed by his Vicar of Lalestone and Newcastle, Bridgend because he filled the churches
with anxious hearers, after which time he was was for over half a century one of the greatest ornaments of the Welsh pulpit with the C.M. at a time when
that pulpit was greatest. He died in 1847.
William Thomas, of Pyle often preached at Longland.
He was not reckoned among the ordained ministers of the connection, but an exhorter. He was the chief instrument in establishing the
Methodist cause at Cornelly, giving the land for ever to the Methodists on which the chapel is built.
We are informed that preaching was continued at Longland occasionally till about the year 1840, since which time the neighbourhood has been well
supplied with suitable places of worship of every denomination.
One of the Welsh bards has given a description of 'Ty Draw,' the home of Mr William Thomas, above mentioned and Longland, when occupied by Mr Howell in the following lines:
In Welsh -
"Cegin, parlwr, cell, s 'sgubor,
Oedd yn rhydd at achos Duw;
'Stafell, gwely, bwrdd, canwyllbren,
A phob peth arall yn ei ryw; -
Arian, aur, pan fyddai eisiau,
Gwair, a cheirch, a phorfa fras;
Eto'r blawd oedd yn y celwrn,
A'r olew byth yn cadw ei flas."
In English -
"Kitchen, parlour, cell and garner,
Were freely given without a pause;
Table, chandlier, bed and chamber,
Every thing towards God's best cause;
Silver, gold, when it was needed,
Hay and corn and pastures green;
Still the meal was in the barrel,
The want of oil was never seen."

KENFIG MARITIME HERITAGE - SHIPWRECKS (20th Century)
S.S. Cato, Nash Sands (March 10, 1940)
The Guinness Wreck
BACKGROUND
The S.S. Cato was built by Campbeltown Shipbuilding Co, Yard No 99. & was requisitioned as a munitions carrier in the First World War.
During World War II and on 10 March 1940 whilst en-route from Dublin to Bristol, the S.S. Cato struck a mine off Nash Point & sank (13 of her 15 crew perished).
THE GUINNESS WRECK
When the S.S. Cato sank off Nash Sands she was carrying a cargo of stout in barrels - these barrels appeared "washed-up" all along the coastline and
many locals enjoyed the free drink that she provided. The shipwreck was aptly nicknamed "The Guinness Wreck"
LOCAL LEGEND
Some tales from around the Kenfig coastline in respect of the Guinness Wreck.
The race was on between customs officials & the locals to secure the barrels and both early morning and late evening stolls along
the local beaches became a very popular pastime. Some were caught in the act of hiding their finds and subsequently prosecuted but many
local households enjoyed the free Guinness that year.
At Porthcawl the customs & excise hired a shed in Newton Dunes to store any barrels recovered which was under lock and key; however
it didn't take the local workforce long to find their own way in - apparently the workforce over-indulged in the stout and couldn't work
the following day as they were in no fit state.
Some of the barrels were found at Kenfig. Due to the remoteness of the dunes it made it difficult for the excise men to recover them.
Regular patrols were made along the beach and any broken barrels found were tipped over allowing their contents to drain into the sand.
The dunes however, provided hiding places for the barrels.
The blacksmith at Gaines Quarry in South Cornelly apparently recovered a barrel from one of these hiding places in the dunes during
the night and transferred it undetected to a shed behind his smithy - there it remained hidden until all its contents had been disposed of over the following months.
Barrels that were hidden in the dunes were visited from time to time by some and jugs & bottles filled up and taken home, however with few permanent
landmarks & the dunes in constant motion through the action of the wind, it is said that some barrels were never recovered & may even still be there today !!!
One tale recalls of a night time Guinness beach party where some revellers sitting astride an empty barrel & singing launched themselves out into
Swansea Bay and were never seen again.
RAF STORMY DOWN
The main beneficiaries from the barrels on Kenfig Beach were said to have been personnel from RAF Stormy Down who possessed the organisation,
the equipment and numbers to recover what barrels came ashore at this location.
A story from a former landlord of the New House Inn, North Cornelly who
was a young lad at the time states that he and his mates went beachcombing at Kenfig at that time, they didn't find any barrels but instead came across an
aircraft from Stormy Down that had made a forced landing due to engine failure. Mechanics from the airfield attended, removed the engine & repaired it in a
makeshift workshop set up nearby.
When the lads arrived they helped the RAF men lift the engine back into its housing of the aircraft - as a thank you the crew invited the lads to
join them for refreshments in their tent - it was Guinness of course !!!
SS Cato 'Barrel Smuggle' 2015
Porthcawl RNLI commemorative Second World War sinking of the SS Cato off Porthcawl's coast in 1940.
On Saturday 19 September, 2015 a short commemorative service was held at the Watch House, Porthcawl harbour which was attended by Porthcawl RNLI
staff and volunteers, Porthcawl Lions Club, Porthcawl Museum & History Society, the Mayor & Mayoress of Porthcawl, the County of Bridgend MP and others
along with friends and relatives of the crew of the SS Cato who travelled to Porthcawl from Bristol to attend the service.
A commemorative plaque was unveiled and poems read to remember those lost in the incident. A walk from Porthcawl RNLI Head Quarters
along the coastal pathway then commenced finishing at the Prince of Wales Inn at Kenfig.
Teams representing Porthcawl RNLI, Porthcawl Museum & History Society, Porthcawl Lions Club and the Prince of Wales Inn (to mention a few)
took part in the walk raising an awareness to the fateful demise of the S.S. Cato and its crew in 1940 and the RNLI. The teams were in fancy
dress and all had to carry an 'empty' beer barrel throughout the journey representing the barrels of Guinness lost in 1940.
The walk culminated at the Prince of Wales Inn at Kenfig where a magnificent feast including entertainment awaited the walkers.

The BBC Wales South East news team picked up on this event and published it on their news website that weekend after having contacted
us via telephone beforehand - Read the article: Porthcawl's Guinness shipwreck remembered

ARCHAEOLOGY AT KENFIG
Archaeological digs at Kenfig were executed throughout the early and latter parts of the 20th century by both the Margam & Aberavon History
Society and the Kenfig Society respectively. In August 2011 Channel 4 Time Team visited Kenfig and spent 3 days excavating the buried medieval
town of Kenfig - their finds were filmed and subsequently aired on television to a global audience.
In October 2013 a Welsh television production company for S4C called Trisgell were invited by the Kenfig Corporation Trust to carry out
an archaeological dig near to the Angel Inn in Mawdlam after viewing aerial photographs showing an oval feature possibly a windmill lying under
the sand. Ground scans confirmed the existance of ditches & possibly an entrance to an iron-age settlement.

KENFIG MARITIME HERITAGE - SHIPWRECKS (20th Century)
S.S. Amazon, Margam Sands (Sept 1, 1908)
Great Havoc Wrought by The Gale - Sailing Vessel Driven Ashore on Margam Sands
The four-masted Barque S.S. Amazon was driven onto Margam Sands in a severe gale. The ship broke up with loss of 20 of her 28 crew.
Twenty Men Perish in the Sight of Thousands
The terrific south-westerly gale which swept the country from end to end on Monday night was one of the fiercest of recent years.
It continued with almost unabated force on Tuesday morning with the result that very serious disaster was caused on sea and land.
The four-masted sailing vessel Amazon, laden with 2,000 tons of coal and bound for Iquique, was driven ashore on Margam Sands and
battered to pieces in the presence of hundreds of helpless spectators.
The rocket apparatus proved ineffective, the lifeboat from the Mumbles, for some reason or other did not arrive and of the crew of
twenty-eight no fewer than twenty gallant sailors (including the captain) were washed from the rigging and drowned.
Other serious mishaps are reported from various places on the South and West Coasts, but, fortunately they were not attended with loss of life.
TRAGEDY OF THE BEACH
Twenty Lives Lost Off Margam
Not since the day when the Agnes Jack foundered off Port Eynon, 25 years ago, has a shipping disaster in the Bristol Channel been
attended with such a serious loss of life as that which happened within hailing distance of Margam Beach on Tuesday morning.
Twenty lives were lost within a hundred yards of the shore and in the presence of some thousands of people who were powerless to
render effective assistance. The spectacle of so many brave men perishing in an angry sea was one of the most sad and thrilling within
living recollection and one which will perpetuate the memory of the terrible storm which swept our seas throughout Monday night and the early hours of Tuesday morning.
With a crew of twenty-eight hands and in command of Captain Garrick, of Penarth, the Amazon, a four-masted vessel, was towed out of Port Talbot Docks on
Monday morning with a cargo of 2,000 tons of coal.
She was bound for Iquique, one of the Chilian ports and at the time of her departure there was only a light south-westerly breeze blowing.
She was towed a far as the Mumbles. By this time the breeze in which they set out of harbour had developed into a gale and Captain Garrick gave
orders to drop one of the anchors, it being found impossible to keep the vessel's head to the wind.
Leaving the Amazon anchored off Mumbles Head, the tug steamed back to port.
THE GALE INCREASES
As night came on the fury of the gale increased and orders were given to drop the port anchor with twenty fathoms of chain. The vessel weathered
the storm until the dawn of Tuesday morning and there was every hope of all being well until the ship began to drag her anchors. Swept by a mountainous
wave which caught the ship full broadside, the starboard anchor was broken away like a toy.
An anchorage was tried on the port side, but to no purpose and the Amazon began to drift up Channel to what was destined to be her doom.
With her broadside to the gale and completely out of control, she was carried swiftly before the gale and Captain Garrick, keenly alive to the perilous
situation, ordered his men to take to the rigging and to provide themselves with life belts.
At the same time the lifeboats were got into readiness to be lowered. As she came within view of a few people who happened to be on the beach the
vessel looked like grounding on the Port Talbot sands, but the gale carried her along in a southerly direction and she did not run aground until she
had reached a point about a mile and a half on the eastern side of the Port Talbot dock entrance.
All this time a tremendous sea was running and there was no abatement in the force of the gale. As the vessel grounded on the sandy beach she
was swept mercilessly by the huge ground swell and at intervals the tops of the masts were barely discernible.
It was about half-past eight when the vessel grounded having drifted for two hours from the time she broke away from her anchorage.
By nine o'clock some hundreds of people had hurried down to the beach from Port Talbot, Aberavon, Margam and the surrounding districts and
in the next half-hour the crowd of spectators had increased to thousands.
Though great in numbers and so near as to be able to hear the shouts of the distressed mariners for help, they were as powerless to give
it as if they had been a thousand miles away.
Gradually sinking into the sand, the vessel became an easy prey to the all-destroying waves. The mast stays snapped like whipcord and one after
another three of the four masts toppled into the sea with sails tattered and torn into shreds. Death was slowly, but surely, overtaking the poor
sailors, most of whom were seen to make the rigging of the only remaining mast as their last resort of escape.
Others were seen to make their final bid for life by jumping overboard and trusting to their lifebelts and their strong arms to carry them safely through
the malestrom of surf. Some of them got safely through, but not until they had been swirled along to the beach near the Morfa Colliery, where they found a
footing and scrambled ashore exhausted. Others who made the attempt found their strength unequal to the task and went down.
HOPE VANISHES
While the mizzenmast of the Amazon remained upright and the men who had climbed into the rigging could retain their hold, there was some hope of saving
them; but even this vanished when the spectators, to their horror, saw the stout timber snap near its base and the men in the rigging hurled into the sea.
The breakers seemed greater and more terrible than ever and the vessel, which from the moment it stranded was a total wreck, was completely enveloped by
the waves. The agonised cries of the sailors could be heard distinctly and women who mingled with the crowd on the beach became hysterical.

THE COASTLINE AROUND KENFIG

GALLANT RESCUER
When the tide had receded so far as to leave the vessel within about 30 yards of the shore several gallant attempts were made to reach her.
Standing out as the noblest deed of all was the effort made by Mr. Charles Russell, an engineer, temporarily residing at Port Talbot.
Mr Russell plunged into the boiling surf and swam to the rescue of one man who continued to cling to the stump of the mast when all the others were swept
away and his gallantry was rewarded by his success in saving the life of Christopher Sullivan.
Russell was badly buffeted and severely injured and he now occupies the adjoining room to that of the man he saved. Almost immediately after Sullivan had
been brought ashore several of the spectators who had scrambled to the side of the Amazon were rejoiced to find that there was still another man alive on board.
He was so tightly wedged in the wreckage as to be almost entirely concealed from view. There was a shout of gladness when he was carried safely to land.
THE CAPTAIN'S FATE
Being well known and held in the highest esteem in the Port Talbot district, it was only natural that much concern should have been felt as to the fate of
the white-bearded veteran, Captain Garrick, but it was not long before all doubt was dispelled.
The brave old mariner had gone down with his ship.
One of the survivors, in giving a narrative of his experiences, said that his skipper was struck a violent blow on the head while he stood at his post
on deck and that when he last saw him the blood was streaming down his face and he appeared to be stunned.
Everything that could be done in the way of giving succour to the survivors was carried out by the local police and dock officials,
who supplied restoratives and carried the men on ambulances from the seashore to the nearest hotels.
Prior to this, however, they were taken to the Morfa Cottages, which are the nearest habitations to that part of the foreshore where the
survivors found a safe footing after their desperate swim for life.
Medical aid was rendered by Dr. J.H. Williams, of Aberavon, who was early on the scene. The Port Talbot dock officials authorised Police inspector
Canton to spare no expense in providing every comfort for the rescued seamen and in communicating with the relatives and friends of all who were on board the Amazon.

The National Library of Wales is undertaking the Cynefin project to digitise the Tithe Maps of Wales & therefore it makes common sense
to work in collaboration with the National Library on this project with specific reference to the Kenfig and surrounding areas that we are
responsible for in the first instance with the Kenfig website. The new Kenfig website will look to integrate elements of the Cynefin project
within its own infrastructure and/or cross-reference works within our own specific area in question in the future.
Tithe Maps
These were payments charged on land users. Originally payments were made using commodities such as crops, wool, milk & stock.
Tithe Maps were produced between 1838 & 1850 to ensure that all tithes were paid with money rather than produce.
Tithe maps are the most detailed maps of their period & cover more than 95% of Wales. Each map lists the payable tithes,
the names of the landowners & land occupiers, the land use & in most cases the field names.
National Library of Wales - Cynefin project
Cynefin Project
The aims of the project are to repair and digitise around 1,200 tithe maps & transcribe over 30,000 pages of index documents.
An online resource is to be created which can be accessed freely to research the tithe maps & their indexes in an efficient and innovative way.
The project is always looking for volunteers to contribute to its works. If anyone is interested in helping this project the website is listed below.
Volunteer works involve the following

Nottage - An Ancient Village (Notais meaning The Pollard Ash Tree)
The original village of Nottage was sited on a small hill lying above the level of the Wilderness marshland and near a stream which flowed
southwards through the Rhyll to an inlet of the sea. Artifacts found in and around Nottage indicate that Beaker Folk, Celts and Romans
inhabitaed the area. There are links with Nottage and St David, the Patron Saint of Wales, including a well in Moor Lane called St David's Well.
During the early 12th century, William Earl of Gloucester awarded his faithful supporter Richard of Cardiff 'for his services, New Town in Margam'
(Ricardo de Kardif pro suo Novam Villam in Margam). The boundary of Novam Villam extended from the sea northwards through Dewiscumbe (The Rhyll) to Park Newydd Farm.
Nottage was outside Novam Villam possibly due to the presence of a Celtic Church. Influences of Norman occupation became more apparent through the centuries.
Activities of the Roman Church, extension of Monastic farming and religious activity, grants of land, marriage and inheritance all combined to create one Parish
and by the year 1300, the Ecclesiastical Parish of Newton-Nottage had been formed.
GHOSTLY goings on in Nottage (Ghost Stories, Superstitions, Legends & Fairy Tales)
MOOR LANE - NOTTAGE
This lane is documented on maps since the 16th century & legends refer to its earlier times of significance.
A section of Nottage Court wall pours over lanes original path; the wall was divided to allow trams & horses access to surrounding area -
this was known as the Dyffryn Llynfi tramway (horse drawn trams transporting coal & iron to pwll cawl bay by an Act drawn up 1825)
Cuckoo Bridge, Nottage
Ffynon Dewi Well, Nottage
NOTTAGE HALT
The halt was a sub-station to the main Porthcawl train station. It was built in 1897 & had the adopted nickname of "Golfer's Halt" as
golfers would leave the train & use horse-drawn carriages to reach their destination. Porthcawl railway line was discontinued in 1964 due
to the Beeching Act resulting in Nottage Halt & track being demolished.
GHOST TRAIN
There is a ghostly noise of an invisible steam train that has been heard on many occasions in the vicinity of Nottage Halt - it is considered lucky to hear this by locals.
CUCKOO BRIDGE
This is a stone bridge in Moor Lane near Nottage which was commissoned by Royal approval under an Act of Parliament on June 10, 1825.
The bridge was opened in 1828 and used as a tramway for horse drawn carriages as part of the Dyffryn Llynvi Porthcawl Railway.
The bridge was later widened to make way for second line, which never materialised. In 1861 a new track was erected to accomodate steam trains when
the tramway made way for railway tracks which were laid by John Hodgkinson of Newport.
GHOSTLY TALES - CUCKOO BRIDGE
The illusionary noise of horses hooves thundering across the bridge have been heard & the misty vision of a headless horseman have
been reported galloping across the silent bridge.
Legend has it that its unlucky to make a sound whilst passing under the bridge as the demons of our past consider it disrespectful - this myth has yet to be proven.
A mystery hitch hiker dressed in old fashioned clothing seems eager to accept a lift from unsuspecting drivers in the vicinity of Cuckoo Bridge.
He is seen standing by the bridge before jumping into the back seat of the passing vehicle.
ST DAVID'S WELL - FFYNON DEWI
The Welsh Patron Saint visited this place in the 6th century and drank from the well. He declared it to be of sacred ground proclaiming water had
important healing powers. The well gets its name from ancient dell of dewiscombe (david's valley) mentioned in 12th century grant by william,
earl of Gloucester to Richard of Cardiff from Novum Villiam in Margan.
An inscription on a stone next to the well was erected in 1903.
GHOSTLY APPARITION IN WELL
The well has its own unique tale of ghostly apparition. The misty but serene face of a little girl peering up from the depths
of the water at dusk has been seen on a number of occasions - it is not known who she was but legend maintains she drowned in a tragic accident.
THE RHYLL
This was a valley just below St David's Well (Ffynon Dewi) which once consisted of a stream & lake which sank through cracks formed in limestone rock
- this formed an underground stream which extended down to the wilderness marshland on right hand side of this lane.

LLANMIHANGEL MILL & FARM
Map Ref: SS 88 SW & OS Ref: SS 819 823
Llanmihangel Mill is located north of the River Kenfig on a lane from Marlas Road, Pyle, to Llanmihangel Farm. The south end of the mill abuts Llanmihangel Mill farmhouse its north end is built into the bank known as Coed-y-Gollen.
The mill is built of rubble sandstone with a slate roof supported on machine-cut timbers. The waterwheel is sutuated at the north end of the mill in an arched chamber accessible only from the tail race.
A BRIEF HISTORY
Llanmihangel Mill or Saint Michaels Mill as it was originally called was part of the Grange of Saint Michael the second largest grange of Margam Abbey. It covered an area of 7 carucates.
Margam Abbey was founded in 1147 AD & was endowed with a large tract of land between the rivers Avon & Kenfig by Robert Earl of Gloucester.
This charter is no longer extant but its text is preserved in an inspexium by Hugh le Despenser dated 9th October 1338 in which William, son of Robert conforms his father's gift. Also granting them, the monks the fishery in Kenfig water provided that my mill of Kenfig be not affected by it.
Pope Urban III's Bull of 1186 which was signed in Verona on 11th November mentions the Grange of Saint Michael & its appurtenances, this is possibly the earliest mention of Llanmihangel Mill.
An apostolic mandate in 1326 required the Abbot of Margam Abbey to draw up a detailed account of properties, income & monies held by the Abbey. In this account under the heading Saint Michaels Grange dated Thursday next after the octave of Easter 1326 the yearly value of a fulling mill is given as Â£1-0-0 and water mill as 13s-4d. The conculsion from this that the manufacture of cloth was more important & of greater financial advantage than the grinding of corn & the making of bread.
Both mills were sited near the River Kenfig, the fulling mill at Ynys-y-Pandy. This was demolished c.1850 when the railway embankment was constructed.
Further reference to Llanmihangel Mill or to be precise, the mill leats can be found in the charter of Thomas le Despenser Lord of Glamorgan dated 16th February in the twentieth year of the reign of Richard II (ie. 1397)
In this he describes part of the boundary thus: and these are the bounds of their liberty, namely, between the place called Newditch and the place called Taddulcrosse and a certain boundary leading from Newditch to Taddulcrosse between the lands of Margam Abbey and the lands of Teakeburie on the east of a certain stream called Blaklaak.
In 1527 John ap Thomas David ap Hoell and John ap John his son were admitted tenants of the watermill called Seynt Mizchells is mylle - the rent being 40 shillings and court suit, two capons or four pence for entry at Kenfig by Sir Cradock, Knight, a steward on the 15th October 1527.
Margam Abbey was surrendered to the crown on 28 February 1537, its buildings & land were disposed of by Crown Sale. Sir Rice Mansel, Knight, Councillor to the King purchased land including the Grange of Saint Michael for the sum of Â£500-0-0 being part payment of Â£938-6-8 dated Westminster 22nd June 1540. The acquittance for Â£438-6-8 being due on the 1st October 1540.
Llanmihangel Mill was not purchased until 1546 when other granges & properties were bought for the sum of Â£678-1-6 dated Hampton Court 28th August 1546.
By the middle of the 18th century cast iron gears were being used in watermills and by the 1820's there must have been a number of foundries in South Wales capable of producing gearing. This was not the case at Llanmihangel Mill.
Mill Accounts 1771-1799
Hopkin Llewellyn, steward of the Margam Estate & lessee of Llanmihangel Mill kept accounts for the mill from 1771-1799. During this period it appears the mill had a timber waterwheel & gears - this is borne out by entries in this account book. A watermill is not just the building, waterwheel & gears but also includes the weir, leats & the mechanisms used to control the flow of water to the mill. Considered in its entirety maintenance of the mill was on-going.
By the turn of the 19th century it is reasonable to assume that the mill had wooden cogs & waterwheel. The cutting of rounds indicates lantern type stone-nuts which would been in permanent mesh with the great spur wheel. The only way of stopping & starting the mill stones was by controlling the flow of the water onto the waterwheel.
It is assumed the wooden cogs were replaced with cast iron ones at the same time as the pit wheel on which the name of the Eaglebush foundary appears - however, no other cog bridging box or other cast iron item in the power train bears this manufacturers name. The waterwheel would still be timber at this time & in good condition.
A large area of Margam Estate was agricultural land & considering the importance of the waterwheel for grinding cereals for flour & animal feed, references to the mill are few & far between. The mills importance would have decreased as the Margam Estate's income relied less on that from the farms & property but more on the copper, coal & iron industries of South Wales.
MAPS OF LLANMIHANGEL MILL
The earliest map on which Llanmihangel Mill appears is one of a series drawn in 1814 when the Margam Estate was surveyed by Robert Wright Hall of Cirencester on the instructions of the trustees of the estate. This is followed by the 1881 25 inch Ordinance Survey map & subsequent issues. A Tythe Map for Margam was not drawn possibly because of its previous monastic associations.

Cornelly or Corneli
The Story of a Village, its history, its people, events and lots more...
South Cornelly
South Cornelly came into being as an Anglo-Norman settlement in the second half of the 12th century. It is the ÂoriginalÂ Cornelly, though a document of the time indicates that it narrowly escaped being known as ÂThomastownÂ
after Thomas son of William who was an early Lord of the Manor here. His descendants subsequently adopted the name ÂDe CornellyÂ and their house is believed to have stood where the mansion called Ty Maen stands behind high walls
on the main road through the village.
The earliest elements of the present building date from around 1650 and it incorporates many unusual features. Above the main door is carved the war cry of the Knights Templar ( Non Nobis Domine, Non Nobis)
whilst a pane of glass in one of the windows depicts a coat of arms believed to be those of Bishop Law of Carlisle Â neither he nor the Templars are known to have any connections with this locality.
A PriestÂs hole was discovered in an upstairs bedroom concealed behind an old cupboard. The site of the old church was in a field where the present day house ÂMeadowriseÂ is located which stood by the wall nearlest the road opposite Ty Maen House.
Education in Cornelly
Former Corneli Council School, Cornelly Cross
North Cornelly
Originally a sub manor of the Kenfig Borough which lay outside the boundaries of the Borough itself, its earliest holders were the Lupellus family who later adopted the name Lovel.
The earliest recorded name of the village from a document that dates from before 1183 is the rather cumbersome ÂThe Vill of Walter LupellusÂ. The name Cornelly arose probably due to its close
proximity to the crossroads (Cornelly Cross) where the road to the original village of Cornelly (Present South Cornelly) branched off from the main road. The village adjoining the Cornelly junction
therefore became known by that name and ÂNorthÂ and ÂSouthÂ were added to distinguish between the two.

We are beginning our quest with the poignant story of a Kenfig Hill man who sacrificed his life for us all, he was only 21 when he died on the battlefields of the Somme
and The Margam Estate receieved news that two young and promising lads from that village had been killed at the Dardanelles, one being the son of the
head coachman to Miss Talbot at Margam Castle and the other being the son of Mr J.V.Morgan, clerk of the works to Miss Talbot.

The Glamorgan Gazette, Friday 15 September 1916
Kenfig Hill Soldier's Death - Pte "Jack" Bowen
One of the most popular young men that Kenfig Hill has given to the Army has made "the great sacrifice." Official news has come to hand that
Pte. Thomas John Bowen, of the Post Office, Kenfig Hill, has been killed in action. "Jack" as he was known to his many friends, was a universal
favourite, his quiet, winning manners endearing him to all. He was a regular attendant at St Theodore's Church and was also a member of the Y.M.C.A.
He joined the 20th Welsh ("Pals" Company) on November 1st, 1915 and was stationed at Kinmel Park, Rhyl, before being drafted to France. He was later
transferred to the 15th Welsh Regiment. He met his death in the "great push" at Mametz Wood on July 10th last, at the early age of 21. Prior to enlistment,
he acted as town postman at Kenfig Hill.
The following letter was received from his commanding officer: "I regret to say Pte T.J.Bowen was killed in the great fight in Mametz Wood.
Please accept my deepest sympathy in the loss of a man who was a credit to his platoon, and who fought a good fight." Needless to say , the greatest
sympathy is felt in the neighbourhood with his parents and relatives in their sad loss.

A Margam War Tragedy
Information reached Margam on Monday that two young and promising lads from that village had been killed at the Dardanelles,
viz, Privates Cyril Ogden and Percy Morgan, of the Royal Engineers.
The former is the son of the head coachman to Miss Talbot at Margam Castle and the other is the son of Mr J.V.Morgan, clerk of the works to Miss Talbot.
Both lads are about 22 years of age and joined together. They were at school together, played cricket with the Margam Club together and enlisted at
the same time and in the same regiment and both were killed with the same shell.
Percy Morgan was a very promising cricketer and had done well for the Margam Club and keen sympathy will be felt with the relatives of both in their bereavement.

HM Prison - Wikipedia
The Margam Estate
The murder which Lewis has expiated on the scaffold was committed on Thursday June 9th on Margam Estate, the victim being Robert Scott a gamekeeper in Miss Talbot's service. Between six and seven o'clock in the evening of the day named Scott and Kidd, two underkeepers were in the deer park to the south east of a woodland known as Cwm Philip and on rising ground.
Hawtin, a police constable employed by the estate was also out some distance away from Kidd and Scott.
The latter saw a man coming down the mountain side a mile or so away and took counsel with his colleague and
PC Hawtin whose attention had been directed to the approaching stranger. The keepers formed a plan for the arrest of the tresspasser,
Scott being told off to go towards the farmhouse of Blaenmallwg whilst Kidd and Hawtin kept along the mountain wall. Scott was seen
by the two other keepers going in the direction of Cwm Philip and Joseph Lewis (for the tresspasser was none other than the man who committed the murder)
was watched until 30 yards distant from the turnip field gate in the neighbourhood of Cwm Philip.
Scott was Unarmed
Lewis carried a loaded double-barrelled gun. Looking over the mountain wall, Lewis must have had his victim within easy range - 14 yards or so away and putting up his gun he fired at the defenceless gamekeeper. The shot was not fatal and poor Scott badly wounded in the face, crawled along the gutter towards a gap in the wall and then exhausted by the loss of blood, swooned away.
Lewis pursued his victim and discharged the remaining barrel, the shot striking the other side of the face of the dying man. Not content with the terrible work already done, Lewis went up to his victim, whom he kicked on the head in order to make sure that the awful crime should not fall short of fatal issues.
The murderer proceeded up the gulley on the mountain side and some distance from the scene of the tragedy hid his gun and ammunition in some brushwood. Dilligent search was made for the body of the victim all through the night, but it was not until about 9 o'clock on the Friday morning that the mangled form was found in the dyke where Lewis had done his victim to death.
Having got rid of the rifle with which the murder was committed, Lewis made his way down the dingle and near Brombil Farm he spoke to tow witnesses who gave evidence at his trial. Proceeding on his way, the wretched man arrived at Aberavon where he found shelter for the night and in the morning obtained a change of clothing from his home in Maesteg.
Lewis was released after the first arrest, the clothes he wore not corresponding with those described as being worn by the man seen in the vicinity of the murder when the crime was committed. Explanation of this circumstance being soon forthcoming, Lewis was re-arrested.
On Tuesday August 9th, the accused was tried before Mr Justice Wills at the Glamorganshire Assizes, Swansea.
When the charge was read over to him of feloniously killing and slaying Robert Scott, the prisioner answered in a firm and clear voice "Not guilty." The most damaging evidence tendered against Lewis was that of witmesses to whom he had practically confessed the crime and the jury, after tow days' trial, found the accused guilty.
Sentenced to Death
In pronouncing the death sentence Mr Justice Wills said, Joseph Lewis you have been found guilty by a jury after the most patient deliberation and I am sure the fullest consideration of your case.
Everything has been said for you that could possibly be said in such a case and the result has been, I should think, to leave no shadow of a doubt on the mind of anybody who has listened to this long trial that the jury have arrived at a perfectly just and right conclusion. There can be no doubt that yours was an act that murdered the unfortunate man. There can be no doubt that you sent him to his last account without a moment's warning.
The law is more merciful to you. I implore you to spend the remaining days of your existence in trying to prepare yourself for the great
change that must come on you for such a crime as you have been guilty of there is but one sentence known to the law and that sentence it is now my duty to pronounce -
that you be taken hence to the place whence you came, and then to the place of execution, and that there you be hanged by the neck till you are dead. And that
your body be buried within the precincts of the gaol at which you shall last have been confined and may the Lord have mercy on you soul.
The prisoner heard the sentence with great firmness.
The Closing Scene
On Tuesday morning in the presence only of the prison officials, Joseph Lewis who murdered Robert Scott, gamekeeper on the Margam Estate under such
appallingly cruel circumstances expiated his terrible crime on the scaffold within the precincts of Swansea Gaol. The tolling of the bell a few minutes
before 8 o'clock conveyed to the knot of morbidly curious spectators who had assembled outside the gaol that the grim sentence of the law pronounced by
Mr Justise Wills was being carried into effect, while the running up of the black flag shortly afterwards was the signal that poor Scott's awful death had been avenged.

Iron Age hill fort found by TV Crew near Kenfig
Archaeologists have found the remains of an Iron Age hill fort in Bridgend county. The discovery at Maudlam village near Kenfig was made during filming for
S4C programme Archaeoleg. Read more ....BBC News South East Wales
Latest News: updated 29 October 2013
During the past week (Mon 21 - Fri 25 October 2013) an archaeological dig has been ongoing at Kenfig searching for remains that could pre-date the lost
Norman town and/or city of Kenfig by centuries.
A Welsh tevelvision production company, Trisgell is producing a 6-part history series to be shown on S4C in 2014 were invited
by the Kenfig Corporation Trust - they chose to dig at a site near to the Angel Inn
in Maudlam after viewing aerial photographs that show an oval feature, possibly a windmill lying under the sand. Ground scans confirmed the existence
of ditches & possibly an entrance to an iron-age settlement.
The lead Archaeologist & presenter Dr Iestyn Jones dubbed the site called 'Twmpath Y Felin Wyllt' meaning Windmill Hill "enigmatic". He also said that
the site is obviously closed, there are banks & ditches all the way around but the sand hides everything that was here originally.
Dr Jones also said, "If it's Iron-Age we're looking at something between 500BC & the Roman occupation - if it's Bronze Age it might be even before that, but
we don't know. This would have pre-dated the village by some considerable time & might have been one of the earliest settlements in this area." The archaeological
dig hopes to uncover pottery which can be analysed to provide an exact date for the settlement in the territory of the Silures Iron-Age tribe.
Further information on this archaeological dig & when the television programme will be screened on S4C will be published on this website in the future.

John Bedford, Ironmaster (c.1720-1791)
Born in the Midlands, England in the early 1770s John Bedford had an ambition to make the area known as 'Waun Cimla' the centre of an industrial empire.
He built an ironworks, brickworks, collieries/mines & a grand house overlooking his realm. Bedford Road, Cefn Cribbwr & the Iron Works are named after him.
The ironworks were abandoned during the mid 19th century & fell into decay. The ironworks were acquired by the former Ogwr Borough Council
(now Bridgend County Borough Council) & a programme of conservation occurred between 1991-1995. Funding was provided by Ogwr Borough Council, CADW-Welsh Historic Monuments,
Welsh Development Agency, Welsh Office & the European Union.
These works have continued since the inception of Bridgend County Borough Council in 1996 with funding from the Welsh Government & in partnership with Y Cefn Gwyrth.
The site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument of National Importance.
The Bedford Ironworks
The repaired stone buildings at the Bedford Ironworks (Cefn Cribbwr) are the remains of the ironworks started by John Bedford, a Birmingham businessman c.1770-1780s
- they were abandoned from the mid 19th century. All the structures found are in a typical late 18th to early 19th century iron works. These include:
1 - Calcining Kilns

6 - Cast House
Raw materials (roasted iron ore, coke & limestone) were taken by trams & loaded into the top of the furnace.
In the coke ovens, coal was partially burnt to drive off impurities. This left a tough but light porous
fuel called coke. All the buildings at the same level as the coke ovens are linked by tramways which
once had iron fish bellied rails to the wide gauge of 4'6". Only the stone sleeper blocks were left
but a new rail & tram have been placed on the site.
The ironmasters found that iron ores could be improved by roasting them in calcining kilns to remove
impurities particularly sulphur which made brittle iron. There are 2 calcining kilns with a tramway
passage between them which are also preserved.
The main function of the charge house (a building located at the level of the top of the furnace) was
to lead a tramway to the platform so that all the raw materials (roasted ore, limestone - for further
purification & coke) could be loaded directly into the top of the furnace.
The Blast Furnace
The Blast Furnace was 32 feet (9.8m) square at the base tapering slightly with the height to rise 10.6m from the hearthstone with
a wide but short circular chimney.
This tapping (casting) arch where iron was run out was the focus of the iron-making process. To melt iron the temperature in the
furnace would have to been around 1,140 degrees Centigrade.
The inner wall & hearth is well preserved, a brick-built foundary furnace to cast iron made in another works was constructed in the
tapping arch by Bedford's successor, William Bryant c. 1830-1840s.
Air to provide the blast was pressurized in the engine house & piped to the 3 blowing arches in the sides of the furnace. The pipes
ended at the tuyeres (pronounced tweers) or iron nozzles set in square openings in the inner walls of the blowing arches.
Next to the Blast Furnace was the Cast House where the molten iron was run out into channels cut in a casting pit full of sand. These
channels were likened to a sow & her piglets - hence 'Pigs' of iron. The small building attached to the east side of the cast house
appears to have been used for further processing of the iron, perhaps by a smith.

History of Education around Kenfig - Coming Soon
Bryndu School, Kenfig Hill (c.1914)
About 1857 C R M Talbot MP, of Margam Estate (Owner of Bryndu Slip Colliery) started a temporary school in colliery stables; known as Bryndu
Works School. In 1860's Bryndu School was built at the end of School Road, Kenfig Hill - it was demolished in 1957.
Throughout Kenfig & surrounding areas, leases, wills and other legal documents were being signed by local inhabitants as far back as
the mid 17th century Â furthermore, these signatures were not only from particularly well-to-do families that had been sent away to be
educated, but from the local peoples of the area as well. In a deed dated 1659 relating to a house called Ty Mawr Â now known as Haregrove
farmhouse, there was mention of a room called ÂThe SkooleÂ.
Cefn Cribbwr School c.1910
Cefn Cribbwr School
This was built in 1894 as Cefn Cribwr Board School in a single small building on the site of its present infant section.
In 1902 the so called 'mixed department' referred to as the 'Big School' was added; the 2 schools soon had several hundred pupils between them which
became inadequate & c.1914 this original building was demolished being replaced by its present one. At that time the school motto was inscribed on the
fron wall of the school - it reads... Esgyn Yw Nod Ysgol - To achieve is the aim of the school.
The school board was abolished & Cefn became a Council School operated by the Glamorgan County Council. The school was refurbished in the 1930's with
a playground & initial corridor for the 'big school' being introduced and a school canteen & central heating were added in 1957 - internal toilets were added
after this date. The early Headmasters appear to have been Welsh baptists - Mr Idris Williams (Headteacher during & after WWII) was a devout Anglican being the first to break
this tradition.

VIEW THE COAST SECTION
The Cyhiraeth
The Cyhiraeth is a ghostly wailing and shrieking sound - this brings fear to all who hear it. It's a certain harbinger of a coming storm or wreck.
Spectre on a White Horse
A spectre on a white horse - if this is encountered on a night of a new moon, the beholder has the certainty of a dreadful end before 12 months have passed.
The Bottomless Pool
In 1857 a story was told in the kenfig area of an Evan Lewis who attempted to cross Kenfig Pool in a horse and carriage. The wheels of the coach snagged
in the remains of the old town beneath the waters, and man, horse and carriage disappeared and were never more seen.
Inquest records and the parish registers show that in 1837 thirteen year old Evan Lewis was drowned in kenfig Pool on 2 September whilst washing a coach
elonging to his master. His body was buried two days later.
Sker House
The spectre of the ill-fated Maid of Sker frequently appeared in an upstairs room, wherein she was said to have been confined by her father.
Her appearances are supposed to have been accompanied by the clanking of chains and other curious phenomena.
R.D.Blackmore's Maid of Sker also featured a ghostly apparition, this time in the guise of a monk. "Abbots walk" within Sker house was the home of a
quarrelsome fellow who fell out with his Holy brethren and came to an untimely end. His spectre groans in the middle of the night.
The Tolaeth...
The Cyhiraeth sometimes brought the "Tolaeth", another sound, less frightening but more ghostly. This was the noise a carpenter would hear at night after
making a coffin when nobody else was in his workshop but himself. It's associated with the sound of hammering.
The Ghost of Pyle Church
Visiting Pyle Church on All Hallows Eve you will hear the ghost relating incidents which were to happen during the ensuing year. It commenced by reciting a
list of parishioners who were destined to die during the year. Then followed the names of those to be married. It is still a mystery of whether young men would
secretly enter the church to make the announcements or whether so great was the superstition of the local people many would implicitly believe it was a ghost.
Gwyneth and Owen
This tale is from the medieval period when Owen, who was a novice at Margam Abbey, had the misfortune to fall in love with a local girl named Gwyneth,
the grand-daughter of a sorceress named Maud living in Cwm Kenfig.
The couple had a regular meeting place near the banks of the river Kenfig, but one day their tryst was brought to an abrupt end by a sudden and violent storm.
As the couple struggled to find shelter they got hopelessly lost and above the raging of the storm and the roar of the swollen river, heard the frightful screams of
the Gwrach Y Rhibyn (Hag of the Mist) mocking the futility of their efforts to reach safety.
All who heard the cry of the Hag knew that some dire misfortune awaited them.
As night fell the doomed couple struggled on, but a demon known as the Torrent Spectre appeared and swept the two into the swollen waters of the river Kenfig.
Later the same night fishermen at Sker were disturbed to hear the eerie keening of the Cyhiraeth whose cry was said to herald the arrival of a corpse on the beach.
As dawn broke it was to reveal the bodies of the two lovers lying on the sands clasped in one another's arms.
Bwci Bo
The field on the north side of Pyle Church, now occupied by a small private housing estate, was once known as "Puckwall".
The name probably dervives from the English sprite Puck, which in turn perhaps originates from the Welsh "Bwca" or "Bwci Bo".
It was believed that Bwci Bo was a goblin or elf who haunted certain farmhouses and if well fed with milk left out for him at night,
would help with the housework whilst the good people slept.
If he were spied upon or ill-treated in anyway, he would bring ill luck to the house and find a new abode for himself. He was sometimes known
as "Bwca'r Trwyn" from his long nose, which differentiates him from the button-nosed Puck of English legend.
A Skeleton from Our Past...
The location of the church of St.James that served the former town of Kenfig buried beneath the sand dunes is thought to be approximately
300 yards south of the remains of Kenfig Castle. The basis for this if from various finds of human bones in the dunes.
One such discovery at the begining of the 20th century is recorded in the book "Annals of South Glamorgan" by Marianne Robertson Spencer, published in 1913.
The graveyard of the old church is buried under the sands and numbers of coffinless skeletons have been found there from time to time - these exposed by the shifting sands.
Not so very long ago, some boys coming over the sand dunes early one morning and crossing the old burial place found an entire skeleton resting on the
sub-soil from which the sand had just been blown. There was no sign of any coffin and every bone was in place... The remains were taken up and interred in the present grave yard.
Kenfig Pool - Vengence is coming!
A local chieftain wronged and wounded a Prince and the latter, with his dying breath, pronounced a curse against the wrongdoer.
The curse was forgotten until one night the decendants of the chieftain heard a fearful cry; "Dial a ddaw! Dial a ddaw!" (Vengence is coming!).
At first it passed unnoticed, but when the cry was repeated night after night, the owner of Kenfig asked the domestic bard what it meant. The bard
repeated the old story of revenge, however this was dismissed and a great feast was undertaken with music and song.
In the midst of the carousal the fearful warning cry was repeatedly heard, and suddenly the earth trembled and water rushed into the place.
Before anybody could escape, the town of Kenfig, with its palace, houses and people was swallowed up and only a deep dark lake or pool remains to mark the scene of the disaster.
In the early part of the nineteenth century traces of the masonary could be seen and felt with grappling irons in the pool...

Site of former passenger station at Porthcawl (looking towards Pyle)
Porthcawl railway station looking towards buffer stops
Porthcawl stands on a low headland at the far edge of a series of small bays to the west of the mouth of the river Ogmore and a few miles below the sourthern
outcrop of the South Wales coalfield.
The railway that served Porthcawl was notable for it was owned by 5 successful undertakings and at various times embodied 3 different gauges.
Porthcawl was the obvious choice for a harbour when in the early 19th century the development of the iron & coal industries along the Cefn Cribbwr ridge and
at Maesteg in the Llynfi Valley created the demand for a shipping outlet.
The Tramroad
The creation of the Duffryn Llynfi & Porthcawl Railway Company in June 1825 (Read more... )
was a tramroad having rails spiked direct to stone blocks & reputedly constructed to the unusual gauge of 4ft 7in with its starting point at Dyffryn Llynvi about
1 Â½ miles north of Maesteg.
This tramroad crossed Maesteg from the east to the west bank of the river Llynfi then passed down the valley through Troedyrhiw, Garth and Tondu where it
followed the north side of Cefn Cribbwr before passing round the west flank of Kenfig Hill to Pyle, Cornelly and Porthcawl.
The total length was 16Â¾ miles in which there was a fall of 490 feet giving an overall average gradient of 1 in 180 descending towards the sea.
The tramroad is reputed to have been opened for horse-drawn traffic in 1829 and 5 years later became connected from Park Slip (west of Tondu) to the town
of Bridgend (about 4 miles south eastwards) by another horse-worked tramroad known as the Bridgend Railway.
Porthcawl branch platforms of Tondu Station May 1949
With the development of industry and traffic the Llynfi Valley Railway Company was incorporated in 1846 & took over the Porthcawl tramroad in 1847 and the Bridgend
Railway in 1854.
in 1855 a further Act was obtained authorising the conversion of both the Porthcawl & Bridgend tramroads into locomotive-worked broad gauge railways connecting
at Bridgend with the South Wales Railway which was opened to Swansea in 1850.

Construction of Grand Pavilion Octagonal Dome 1932
The Grand Pavilion was built on a piece of land known as 'Brogden's Field' by the Porthcawl Urban District Council & was the brainchild of Cllr Russell Mabley JP.
The building was designed by architect E.J.E.Moore on 07 Dec 1931 being fabled to have been based on a similar styled building in Singapore.
The cutting of the 1st sod was on 9 Oct 1931 when the site was cleared & foundations began.
By early 1932 its structure had taken shape & work started on the erection of the ferrous concrete octagonal dome.
Due to the importance of the use of ferrous concrete in the construction of the dome, the Grand Pavilion was given a Grade II listed status in 1998.
The Grand Pavilion & Winter Gardens were built at a cost of Â£25,000.00 - The 2-faced clock situated atop the front facade of the building is
known as the Queen Alexandra Memorial Clock & was erected by public subscription.
The Grand Pavilion celebrates its 80th birthday today & is operated by Bridgend County Borough Council's Arts & Culture Service.

THE COAST - HISTORY - ON THIS DAY (23 April 1947)
The Samtampa / Edward Prince of Wales Lifeboat Tragedy
The Samtampa
On this day, 23 April in 1947 (69 years ago) one of the worst maritime disasters in living memory along the South Wales coastline happened.
The Samtampa cargo ship with all 39 crew along with all 8 Lifeboatmen of Edward Prince of Wales Lifeboat from Mumbles perished on the rocks at Sker
in attrocious weather conditions. The Samtampa was broken into 3 parts - the Mumbles Lifeboat found smashed and upside down on the rocks.
The Tragedy
The Samtampa, a former Liberty Ship, was on a voyage from Middlesborugh to Newport, in ballast. A strong westerly gale was in progress when
she entered the Bristol Channel where the ship developed an engine fault. It was decided by her Captain, H. Neale Sherwell to drop anchor in Swansea
Bay to carry out repairs to the engine. The weather was deteriating by the minute and at 4.38pm the starboard anchor chain parted and 12 minutes later the port cable snapped.
The Samtampa was taken eastwards in the hurricane force winds and within 20 minutes she was on the rocky ledges near Sker Point.
The Mumbles Lifeboat
EDWARD, PRINCE OF WALES was launched just after 6pm to go to the rescue. William Gammon, who had been Lifeboat Coxswain for 7 years, was at the helm of the
lifeboat as they headed across Swansea bay to Sker.
At the same time the Porthcawl Coastguards and rocket team were attempting to get a line to the wreck from the shore. The wind speed was said to have been
in excess of 100 mph and in less than 5 minutes of the Samtampa hitting the rocks she started to break up.
Around 2 hours later she was a total wreck, the 10m waves having broken her into large pieces. The rocket apparatus became ineffective due to the
extreme high winds and a line out to the stricken vessel failed. It is said that some of the rockets were driven back so far by the ferrocious
wind that they landed in fields behind the rocket operators themselves.
All crew of the Samtampa were drowned - the full disaster was realised by the morning of 24 April. The Mumbles Lifeboat had failed to return,
and instead was found smashed upside down on Sker Rocks. When the town of Mumbles, Swansea learned of the news, the whole town was in mourning.
The Crew of S.S. Samtampa
25 of the crew of the Samtampa were from the North East of England. 10 of whom were from Middlesbrough, 4 from Whitby, 2 each from Stockton,
Redcar and Staithes and 1 each from South Bank, Skelton, Bishop Auckland, West Hartlepool and Thornaby.
In Memory of all who perished on that fateful day
To the Memory of the Captain And the thirty eight Crew Members Of the Freighter S.S. SAMTAMPA Who perished on these rocks In the Great Storm of
April 23rd 1947, And of the Cox'n and Crew of Seven of the Mumbles Lifeboat, "EDWARD PRINCE OF WALES" Who lost their lives in their valiant rescue attempt.

Turnpike Trust - Wikipedia
Thomas le Despenser (1st Earl of Gloucester) - Wikipedia
Dyffryn Llynfi Railway
The base of this cross stands almost completely buried by sand in the dunes a little north east of the crossroads formed by the junction of Heol Fach
(North Cornelly) with the road from Marlas to Maudlam near Maudlam Cross; this was once a trackway which crossed Mont Mawr near Maudlam Cross.
The cross itself has long disappeared but its socketed base (a moulded Sutton block) is still visible. It presumably marks the original site of this
crossroads which has been 'pushed' inland away from it by the advancing sand - its name seems to imply that it was originally a place used by local
people as a meeting point at which differences and disputes between them could be settled.
Historical Information - The Kenfig Charters c.1397
Croes y Ddadl or the Cross of Debate is referred to in Thomas le Despenser's Charter to the Kenfig burgesses c.1397 where its called
Taddulcrosse. Tradition has it that minor differences between the burgesses were thrashed out there, a belief that might have some glimmer of truth as
crosses played an important part in the lives of the peoples in medieval days which were objects of veneration and when set up in market
places, traders were aware of their presence & conducted their business in an honourable fashion.
Turnpike Trust Dispute - 1843
The Croes y Ddadl was centre of serious deliberation on 26 October 1843 when a crowd of over 500 angry local farmers & freeholders assembled there
to protest against the burdens imposed by the toll-gates set up by the Bridgend Trust. After a heated discussion, Jehosophat Powell of Eglwysnunydd
was chosen to present a petition to the Trust requesting the removal of the gates at Redhill, Pyle (Stormy Down) and Taibach, Port Talbot.
The disputes arose that merchants were attempting to bypass the Borough Markets by utilzing the Pont Velin Newydd crossing (Water Street).
As documented in the Swansea Journal of 01 November 1843, there were 2 trouble spots at Pyle - these were:
Toll bar set up in 1834 above the old Dyffryn Llynfi Railway
Toll gate placed at Pyle Cross in 1840 to exact tolls from people using the parish road to Maudlam
In addition to this a chain was placed across the main road running from Bridgend to Aberavon.

HISTORY - MEDIEVAL KENFIG
The Kenfig Ordinances (Bye-Laws)
The ancient medieval town of Kenfig's bye-laws or Ordinances make for interesting reading at the beginning of the 21st century as they reflect
the customs of that point in time together with the pattern of life within medieval Kenfig showing it to be a well regulated community. A copy of the
Kenfig Ordinances that were drawn up & revised dates from c.1330 - these would have been made by the Portreeve or chief municipal officer & his aldermen at Kenfig.
Bakers, Brewers & Tanners
The town's bakers who were licenced by the Portreeve were ordered to bake wholesome bread of a standard weight fixed by the corporation
'on pain of grevious amerciament (fine) and further punishments provided by his Majesty's laws & statues for such heinous and intolerable offences.
Similar ordinances applied to brewers and tanners.
Butchers
Butchers were forbidden to sell meat on Sundays or to slaughter or scald animals in the High Street; if they were burgesses they had to conduct their
business under the town shambles. Non-resident butchers could only conduct business on Fridays & Saturdays.
Fighting or Brawling
Brawlers in the town who drew blood were to be amerced 3s.4d. for the offence with additional fines for the affray at the Portreeve's pleasure.
Sanitation
To ensure a measure of sanitation butchers were fined for casting heads & feet of animals and any other offal into the High Street or elsewhere in the town.

Horse-drawn coal dram
Seal of the Duffryn Llynvi & Porthcawl Railway Company
Background
Built between 1825 and 1829, The Dyffryn Llynfi & Porthcawl Railway connected a new harbour built at Porthcawl
with iron works that had sprung up further inland at Cefn Cribbwr, Aberkenfig and Maesteg.
The railway covered a total distance of 16Â¾ miles descending some 490 feet from its starting point
near Caerau, Maesteg. Designed for horse-drawn traffic it was a single track line with passing places and was
built to a 4ft 6inch gauge with the rails fixed to stone blocks rather than wooden sleepers so as to leave
a clear path between which horses and handlers could walk along.
A time-table dating from 1855 shows that it took 6Â¼ hours to travel from the terminus in the valley
to Porthcawl and that the return trip was about 2Â¼ hours longer.
The trains brought iron and coal to the coast for export to worldwide destinations and on the return trip
stopped at South Cornelly to collect lime for use at the iron works. As lime was an effective fertilizer, several
farmers in the Maesteg area with arrangement with the railway company, operated their own trams on the line
to collect supplies for their own use.
Passengers
Map of Kenfig Hill area
Passenger traffic started on the line as early as 1836 and became increasingly important when the track
was converted to use by steam trains in 1861 making Porthcawl a popular destination for day trippers and holiday
makers alike. This section of line from Porthcawl to Cefn Cribbwr junction remained operational until the 1960's when
it was closed as a result of the Beeching Act.
At south Cornelly where a lane crossed the railway by a manned level crossing - the former gate keeper's
house still survives as a modernised private dwelling whilst opposite it stands the former local public house
known as The Three Horse Shoes (Originally called The Horse and Tram).
The public house fronted onto the railway and offered welcome refreshment for hauliers working the line
before setting off on the long return journey back to Maesteg.
This public house is now a private residence.

ON THIS DAY - 28 FEBRUARY 1537
Margam Abbey - (c.1147-1536)
Margam Abbey c.1147-1536
On this day in 1537 (477 years ago) Margam Abbey was surrendered to King Henry VIII under the Dissolution of the Monastries Act.
Historical Background
Founded in 1147 by Robert, Earl of Gloucester, Margam Abbey was a Cistercian Abbey of the Mother House Clairvaux - its dissolution came
about in 1536 and was the first abbey to fall under the Dissolution of the Monastries by King Henry VIII.
The Abbey is dedicated to St Mary the Virgin and dates from the 2nd half of 12th century. There is no documentary evidence relating to Margam prior to
the arrival of the Normans, however, carved & inscribed monuments nearby indicate an earlier Christian presence. The Abbey is believed to have been built
on or near the site of an important Celtic monastic house.

Cefn Cribbwr
Siloam Chapel
Built in 1827, this was the first chapel to be built in Cefn Cribbwr. It is the oldest of the six places of worship in the village.
It is located at the top of Bedford Road and is set back off the road itself. The present day chapel is not the original as the structure
was rebuilt in 1855. It is a large structure with a cemetery to the front and rear. The original congregation were Welsh speakers, many of whom were local miners.
Kenfig Hill
St Theodore's Church & Vicarage
The Vicarage was born out of the vision & inspiration of Rev. Joshua Pritchard Hughes and was known locally as 'Bryn Eglwys' which was probably erected in 1882
before the church of St Theodore's alongside was built in 1889. It didn't become a vicarage until 1923 when Kenfig Hill became a Parish in its own right -
the building was demolished in 2007 for the development of housing after serving its community for over 125 years.
St Theodore's Church was supported & built by the Talbot Family of the Margam Estate and was named in honouring CRM Talbot's only son & heir who had died
following a riding accident in June 1876. More... St Theodore's Church & Vicarage, Kenfig Hill

THE CORNELLY CHRONICLES - THE HISTORY OF CORNELLY
North & South Cornelly (sub-manors of the ancient borough of Kenfig)
Ty Maen, South Cornelly
South Cornelly - Brief History
South Cornelly came into being as an Anglo-Norman settlement in the second half of the 12th century.
It is the 'original' Cornelly, though a document of the time indicates that it narrowly escaped being known	as 'Thomastown' after Thomas son of William who was
an early Lord of the Manor here. His descendants subsequently adopted the name 'De Cornelly' and their house is believed to have stood
where the mansion called Ty Maen stands behind high walls on the main road through the village.
The earliest elements of the present building date from around 1650 and it incorporates many unusual features.
Above the main door is carved the war cry of the Knights Templar (
Non Nobis Domine, Non Nobis) whilst a pane of glass in one of the windows
depicts a coat of arms believed to be those of Bishop Law of Carlisle -	neither he nor the Templars are known to have any
connections with this locality. A Priest's hole was discovered in an upstairs bedroom concealed behind an old cupboard.
The site of the old church was in a field where the present day house 'Meadowrise' is located which stood by the wall
nearlest the road opposite Ty Maen House.
Lamb Row (Rhes Yr Oen)
Lamb Row, South Cornelly
Lamb Row was the original main street which led from the main road up to the small medieval chapel at the foot
of a rocky outcrop. Legend has it that the chapel was connected to Ty Maen by an underground passage - the chapel was dedicated
to a Breton saint named Cornelius from which the village took its name. The chapel was turned in to a cottage but
now is a forlorn ruin in the garden of a private house.
Not apparent when seen from the village, the entire back of the hill against which the chapel stood has been
quarried away over the past two centuries to supply lime for the iron and steel industry. It was one of several
such limeworks in the area and in the past South Cornelly and the surrounding countryside were perpetually coated
with light grey dust from the quarries and kilns.

North Cornelly - Brief History
Cornelly Cross
Originally a sub manor of the Kenfig Borough which lay outside the boundaries of the Borough itself, its earliest holders were the Lupellus
family who later adopted the name Lovel. The earliest recorded name of the village from a document that dates from before 1183 is the rather cumbersome
'The Vill of Walter Lupellus'. The name Cornelly arose probably due to its close proximity to the crossroads (Cornelly Cross) where the road to the original
village of Cornelly (Present South Cornelly) branched off from the main road. The village adjoining the Cornelly junction therefore became known
by that name and 'North' and 'South' were added to distinguish between the two.
North Cornelly Cross
Once known as Croes y Green, this crossroads which stands at the heart of modern-day North Cornelly has been here for well over 700 years.
The original village lay some distance away from the cross to the north east in the area between the manor house (Hall Farm) and the present day New House Inn.
A blacksmith's shop was built on North Cornelly Cross about 1738 which continued in use until the early part of the 20th century.
Hall Farm North Cornelly
Hall Farm - The Hall Manor
Map of Kenfig / Pyle District (A. Leslie Evans)
This house in North Cornelly was built by Roger Gramus in 1245AD and preserves features of the Tudor building owned by the Turbervilles of Penllyne
[ Prominent Parish Surnames - Turbervilles ]
- Thomas Gray (c.1909) suggested that it occupied the site once owned by the Grammus family who flourished in the area in the 12th &
13th centuries. The courtyard at the rear is bounded by the battered walls of a ruined building of an earlier date.
Local Roads - Street Names
Heol Fach (Little Road)
Heol Fach, North Cornelly
Despite its name (perhaps acquired when the 'Big Road' through Pyle was opened in the 15th century), Heol Fach during the medieval period was part of
the main highway through the coastal plain of Glamorgan.
Analysis of medieval documents shows that this road descended from Stormy Down along what is now 'Heol Y Sheet' on Broadlands Estate, as far as
Cornelly Cross and then headed towards the town of Kenfig. It was probably from this earlier period that it acquired the name of 'Cartway' which is
often given as an alternative in 17th century documents.
At the 'Croes Y Ddadl' road junction, (Maudlam Cross), Heol Fach connected with the ancient trackway leading down from Cefn Cribbwr to the coast.
The road to Pont Velin Newydd (certainly in being in the 13th century) and presumably a road leading direct to the town of Kenfig.
Water Street
Water Street which was part of the Roman coastal road, via Julia Maritima was called 'Heol-y-Troedwyr' (Road of the foot soldiers).
Julia Maritima
The Julia Maritima from Gloucester to Carmarthen passed Stormy Down, Cornelly, Maudlam and Kenfig to the south of the main road as far as Cwrt-y-Defaid.

Anniversary of 1607 killer wave - BBC NEWS.
At Kenfig, the sand made further inroads - times were also hard; there were bad harvests in the 1620's and 1630's due to excessive rain.
This also caused increased mortality of livestock, thus pushing up the price of all foodstuffs. Homes at this time were often workshops,
peasant farmers having to exploit every means possible to make ends meet.
Cottage Industries
Looms were set up in cottages where the whole family would help with the spinning, combing, weaving and stocking-knitting.
People made their own clothes and also sold garments at local fairs and markets. Tanning was also often carried in conjunction with
small-scale farming. It required a plentiful supply of oak bark, water and lime, all of which were available within the Kenfig area.
Some local People
William Reese of Pyle and Kenfig was a cordwainer (Shoemaker) who also owned a cow, horse, lambs and ewes, grain and corn.
Richard Thomas of Kenfig was able to earn his living solely by being a cordwainer. In 1634 tanned hides were regulary exported from Newton.
In 1654 John Leyshon held a lease of all veins and mines of coal in Rugge (Cefn Cribbwr) lying 'Within the liberty of the Borough of Kenfig'.
He was a registered seaman and it is thought that coal was transported on the backs of horses or mules from Cefn to Newton to be shipped out.
The coal would have been cut out of the bottom of shallow bell pits and carried in baskets up ladders to the surface.

When Charles I became King in 1625 he believed he could rule by divine right without advice from Parliament. When civil war broke out between
his supporters and Oliver Cromwell's Parliamentarians, Wales was mostly Royalist in sympathy, the Kenfig area being no exception.
After Cromwell's death in 1658 his son failed to maintain politcal stability and Charles II was welcomed back from exile since people
were tired of the restrictions imposed by Puritan rule. By the summer of 1659 there had been a weeding out of political figures in
Glamorgan who had supported Cromwell's Protectorate.
In 1662 the Act of Uniformity was passed, compelling people to conform to rules of the Established Church and to use the Book of Common Prayer.
Lewis Aylward (Portreeve of the Kenfig Borough) was an ardent non-conformist and his house (either present day Kenfig Farm or Pool Farm), was used
for meetings after the passing of the Act. In 1664, a troop of soldiers arrested Jacob Christopher, a preacher at the house but he was later released.
He continued to use Aylward's house for meetings from 1672-75 but died a year later and was buried at Maudlam.
James II became King in 1685 and was unpopular with many people and with Parliament because he was suspected of trying to revert the country to the
Catholic faith. When the Duke of Monmouth tried to displace James, the same Lewis Aylward, along with Thomas Lougher of South Cornelly (Constable of Kenfig Castle),
was imprisoned in Chepstow Castle on the grounds he was sympathetic to Monmouth's cause. After Monmouth was beheaded in 1685 they were both freed.
Some Roman Catholic priests were executed for their faith in James' reign. Parliament ordered the local Justices of the Peace to seek them out.
Philip Evans was arrested at Sker House (Owned by Christopher Turberville) in 1678 and was later hung, drawn and quartered in Cardiff. He was canonized in 1970.
Kenfig - The 1660 Survey
In the mid 17th century it is known that only one cottage near the old Kenfig castle was occupied. A survey of the Borough was made in 1660 for it's lord,
the Earl of Pembroke,
by a jury of burgesses. It defined the Borough's boundaries.
At this time burgesses were sworn in by the portreeve without payment. Anyone could be a burgess as long as the portreeve and his aldermen agreed.
The portreeve, sergeant, constable of the castle, heyward and two ale-tasters were elected each year by all the burgesses.
This resulted in rather a confused situation, especially when several burgesses were sworn in at the same time.
The jurors admitted they did not know how many burgesses were within the Borough who ought to perform their 'suit of court' obligation.
Furthermore, they did not know how many houses or how many acres in the Borough had been overcome by sand.
Within the Borough and under the Lordship were two manors of free socage tenure.
(socage = rent; free socage tenure meant held by free men on payment of rent)
These were the Paschall Hill holding (129 acres) and another unnamed holding of 145 acres. There were 19 people who rented various acreages of the
Paschall Hill holding at two and a half pence per acre. The 145 acres was divided between 20 tenants who again held various amounts at the nominal rent of
one red rose and three peppercorns a year. The tenants of the above holdings may or may not have been burgesses.
The 1660 survey also stated that one third of Kenfig Down (at Sker) which had been held by the monks of Neath Abbey was now held by Thomas Turberville
and enclosed. The rent of this unknown acreage was five shillings a year and paid to the Earl, but Thomas Turberville received the profit and benefit of that land.
The other two-thirds of the Down had been rented by the burgesses for ten shillings a year 'time out of mind' but now some of it was enclosed by them and they
could rent it to non-burgesses and receive the profit. They held an unknown quantity of enclosed land in the common called Rugge (Cefn Cribbwr) in the same way.
The fishing rights of Kenfig Pool were also theirs.
Local Fashions
During this century of Stuart rule fashions changed considerably. Men's hair was long and curled, cavalier's dress was elaborate with long
lace collars and cuffs, loose breeches with ribbons at the knees and wide leather boots.
Women's skirts were high waisted and often looped up. The puritans, in marked contrast wore plain dark garments with white collars and aprons.
They wore their hair short. When Charles II came to the throne, rich people dressed even more elaborately and expensively but the poor still wore simple wollen garments.
The homes of the poor were draughty and smokey as chimneys were dispensed of due to Chimney Tax. Glass was also taxed so windows were made with paper
soaked in oil. The better off people had comfortable homes with four-poster beds and padded chairs in contrast.

The Beginning of The Margam Estate - 1668
The Earl of Pembroke
sold his manor of Kenfig to Sir Edward Mansel
of Margam for Â£525 (five hundred and twenty five pounds) in 1668.
It included decayed castle, all property, lands, woods, mineral rights at Cefn Cribbwr, waters, warrens, fishing, rents and other rights.
Sir Edward's descendants, the Mansel-Talbots inherited these until the estate was broken up and sold in 1941.

Manorial Courts at Kenfig
Early records of manorial courts held in the Pyle and Kenfig district begin in 1676. They were presided over by the stewards and portreeve and there were three types:
Courts Baron - were held monthly to deal with the rents, services and heriots due from tenants.
Courts Leet - Petty criminal courts, these were only held twice a year.
Court of Pleas - these heard actions pertaining to land and were held monthly.
Petty offences included selling ale at short measure, not grinding corn at the mill where 'suit of mill' licence was held, not repairing the highway,
not assisting in planting sedges and shooting partridges within the Borough precinct. The courts continued in the area until 1816.
Court Records
Court records show that in 1676 the River Kenfig was blocked with sand.
In 1682 there is reference to a 'Wigmore Road' leading to the sea at Sker.
Wigmore was the burning of seaweed to provide fertiliser for the land. It is also known that lime-burning went on at Cornelly - there being a plentiful
supply of limestone as well as coal not too far away. Often lime was applied far too liberally as it was thought of as a fertiliser.

Gangs of men known as the Cefn Riders & the Red Goblins have become legendary figures in local folklore within the Kenfig & surrounding area.
Cefn Cribbwr is a sprawling village running along the top of a spur or ridge whose height & shape give it a commanding position in the area.
From anywhere in Cefn the surrounding countryside can clearly be seen and the potential for defence was spotted by its earliest peoples; the ancient Britons
built a camp or fort here which was known as Castell Kribor, defences were also built on the appproach routes to Cefn eg. Pyle.
From the top of the ridge the people of Cefn were able to look about them and feel quite secure. By the 19th century they had almost become
a people apart & any stranger visiting the area would be eyed with silent hostility and suspicion & at worst attacked so fiercely they would think
twice before venturing there again.
The soil on the ridges was so poor that it was impossible for any large community to remain there and so bands of tougher men descended upon the
lowlands taking what they required. No farm or building was safe, sheep and cattle began to disappear in large quantities. From this small step to
plain thuggery the Cefn Riders as they came to be called roamed far & wide attacking strangers and packmen.
Travelling mostly on foot but sometimes on horseback they became greatly feared as far afield as Merthyr and the Vale of Glamorgan; showing
little mercy to their victims - there is a very good description of 1 of their attacks in Alexander Cordell's, 'The Fire People' in which the Riders
indulge in a favourite pastime of leaping on a traveller's back & forcing them to carry them some way along the journey.
The Red Goblins
The Red Goblins lived in the mountainous area between the Garw & Maesteg, these too were a band of ruffians living on what they stole
from peoples living in the lowlands. From their caves on the mountainside they travelled in sweeping raids. Their favourite hunting
ground was from the Vale of Glamorgan to the coast.
On one occasion they caught the Carmarthenshire Drovers on their way to the meat markets of London & stole their entire herd, on another
occasion they captured an aristocratic lady of the Carne family & held her to ransome.
The Red Goblins appear to have been capable of gallant acts & they always treated women honourably. Sometimes 'men of good breeding' joined
the gang in search of adventure - in spite of this, mothers were able to
make their children behave with the phrase...
Hush! or the Red Goblins will get you.

The movement in Kenfig Hill started c.1909 when the first class was held at Kenfig Hill School for the purpose of rendering First Aid to the injured.
After 2 years a committee was formed which met at the home of Dr Cooper. First Aid grew to such an extent that classes were held at the Talbot Institute from 23 March 1912
- the Kenfig Hill Division was officially formed in this year with the Cefn Cribbwr Division being formed in 1913.
Prize draws & concerts were organised to raise funds to purchase uniforms with equipment & stretchers kindly donated. There were an average of 120 injuries
treated each year by the Kenfig Hill Division.
The Ambulance Hall
This was built in 1914 at a cost of Â£190. It was located to the north of Mynydd Cynffig Junior School on the site presently occupied by the Air Training Corps
Headquaters (2117 (Kenfig Hill) Squadron - Air Training Corps). When the division celebrated its 25th anniversary in 1937 it consisted of 23 Ambulance men,
a nursing division of 14 & a cadet force of 25.
The division had a fine team which won many cups & shields at the National Eisteddfod Ambulance Competitions.
In 1924 the St John Priory of Wales stationed an Ambulance Car at Kenfig Hill which was initially housed near the Ambulance Hall but was moved to a garage on
Pisgah Street opposite Pyle Welfare (Pyle Life Centre) when the ambulance hall was taken down.
The Ambulance Hall was demolished in the late 1970's and the division was wound up for practicable purposes in 1984.
Llanfihangel Mill & Farm
The Kenfig Community - Pyle / Pil
Llanfihangel Mill & Farm - Mentioned in 1186
Llanfihangel Mill, Pyle c.1920's
One of the Granges of Margam Abbey - The Mill was fed via a sluce from a dam & waterfall upstream at the Collwyn. The mill was still working in 1926.
Stone Bridge over River Kenfig
Stone Bridge over River Kenfig
The old mill is situated in a hollow below Marlas and is approached via a stone bridge over the River Kenfig. In former times it was held
by the monks of Margam as one of the Granges of Margam Abbey (St. Michael's) and was attached to the nearlby farm - mention to this is made in 1186.
The mill was leased by lay tenants and served the needs of the people around Pyle until 1926. The Mill was fed via a sluce from a dam & waterfall upstream
at the Collwyn.
The earliest known lay tenant was Thomas ap David who secured a lease upon the mill in 1527.
Following the dissolution of Margam Abbey the mill was acquired by the Mansel family (1536 - 1750)
at this time there were 3 other corn mills operating in the area but by 1700 Llanfihangel was the only 1 still operational.
Between 1724-1725 considerable renovation work were carried out and by 1739 a drying kiln had been added. In 1751 machinery for a second mill had been installed.
(The tenant at this time was Edward Harris (d.1756) who was Portreeve of the Kenfig Borough for 14 consecutive years between 1742 & 1756
- Kenfig Portreeves 1339-1886)
The farm which is screened from view from the highway has labelled & mullioned windows which date from the late 16th century. When new windows
were inserted in the south wall in 1959 sections of a small moulded & cusped 14th century window were found. Scores of pigeon holes can be seen in the
northern pine end and nearby stands a large ruined building believed to have been used as a tithe barn. In 1358 and abbey lay brother named Meuric who
worked at the grange was indicted for harbouring felons there.
Ffynnon Collwyn Spring
Along the Collwyn behind St James' Church a flight of steps leads down to a small spring at the very edge of the
river. This is known as Ffynnon Collwyn and was formally a healing well, the waters of which were claimed to have medicinal properties.
Unusual Story Connected with the Mill
In 1833 an 11 year old girl named Ann Thomas was at the mill when her clothing became caught in the machinery "which machinery whirled her about
with such violence as to mangle her whole frame in such a shocking manner as caused her instantaneous death". The girl was the daughter of a carpenter named Thomas Thomas
from Pyle - 8 years later he was employed to carry out repairs to the waterwheel; "His foot slipt or entangled in the said water wheel, so that his head went
between the said water wheel and the wall, by means whereof the said Thomas Thomas then and there instantly died".

Local Shipwrecks:
CATERINA - lost at Sker Point on 28 December 1781
Image source: The Shipwreck 1772 (Claude Vernet)
Marine Art - Wikipedia
On this day in 1781 (232 years ago), the vessel CATERINA was lost at Sker Point. Hundreds of local people converged upon the wreck with a lawless attitude
totally indifferent to the sufferance of her crew. The newly formed fellowship put a guard on the ship and a pitch battle broke out - 3 people were killed.
Hanged for Plundering
The plunderers were later caught and jailed but tranferred to Hereford to prevent the locals from freeing them. One of these, John Webb was later hanged.
The cargo of the CATERINA consisted of cotton, several casks of wine, brandy, currants & other goods.
Footnote:
Some 28 years before the wreck of the CATERINA in 1753, a similar occurrence of the shameful plundering of wrecks by local people happened with
LE VAINQUEUR again at Sker and in the same month.
Outling the severity with which the authorities meant to deal with offenders by affixing noticies to local parish church doors advising,
"that the looting of wrecks was punishable by death" this didn't seem work as a deterent to the practise of looting wrecked vessels.

KENFIG THROUGH THE AGES - 16TH CENTURY KENFIG
King Henry VIII & Kenfig
King Henry VIII Wikipedia
King Henry VIII
Photo: Wikipedia
The overwhelming of Kenfig by the sands in the late 15th century was just a memory by 1538 when Leland, the Kings Antiquary visited the area.
He wrote of the castle and village being in ruins and 'almost shokid and devourid with sand that the Severne Se castith up'. He referred to the
Kenfig River as Colebrooke and mentioned good corn and grass at Sker.
At this time, King Henry VIII dissolved the monastries. Margam was the first to go in Glamorgan and when the monks left, all their property,
which included some burgages at the site of the old town of Kenfig, fell to the Crown. The lands were sold to various buyers and Margam, Pyle,
Stormy, Kenfig Higher (the area north of the Kenfig river) and coal pits in Cefn Cribbwr were acquired in 1546 by Sir Rice Mansel of Oxwich and Penrice in the Gower.
He settled at Margam a little later. The Lordship of Kenfig Borough itself was Henry VIII's since he was Lord of Glamorgan, but by 1550 it was sold to
Sir William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke.
Life in 16th Century Kenfig
Tudor Period (1485-1603) / Elizabethan Era
During the Tudor period, houses in some areas were constructed of a timber framework (usually of oak) with wattle and plaster in between and
topped with a thatched roof. Many great oaks grew at Margam and it is known that some were transported as far as Plymouth for ship building.
It is probable that most of the houses in the area now known as Ton Kenfig and in the village of Maudlam were built of local stone.
The Guildhall, the present 'Prince of Wales Inn' dates from the 16th century as does Sker House.
Glass was expensive so was only seen in the houses of the wealthy. Homes of farmers and merchants contained furniture such as settles,
wooden armchairs, carved beds with feather mattresses lain across ropes and wollen blankets.
Peasant's huts were more sparsely furnished with just a few stools, pots and a wooden chest. The hut floor was of earth and the
fire was built on a hearthstone with a basket hood to take the smoke out through the smoke hole.
Poor people wore rough cotton or wollen clothes while a well-off farmer dressed in leather doublet and hose. Wealthy women had tight-bodied
dresses with padded sleeves and cloaks were worn in cold weather. The climate deteriorated over western Europe during the latter half of the
century and there was a succession of bad harvests and a famine in 1556.
Working in the area
Llanfihangel Mill, Pyle c.1920's
One of the Granges of Margam Abbey - The Mill was fed via a sluce from a dam & waterfall upstream at the Collwyn. The mill was still working in 1926.
Although iron and coal working was gradually on the increase in Glamorgan, most of the people worked on the land including those of the
Kenfig area. Many died from malnutrition and there was also an influenza epidemic.
In Elizabeth I's region, laws were made to help the poor since the closing of the monasteries meant there were no monks to provide
charity and the practice of keeping sheep had resulted in fewer people required to work the soil. More corn was grown and the numbers of cattle increased.
At this time there were water mills for grinding corn at Llanfihangel Farm and at Pont Felin Newydd.

Elizabeth I was determined to thwart the Catholic Counter Reformation which had begun in the reign of Mary Tudor. Those who refused to attend Church of
England services were fined twenty pounds a month and then two thirds of their estates were fortified if the fine was not paid. In 1585 it was high treason
for Popish priests to remain in the country.
Despite these measures the people of Kenfig and surrounding areas remained faithful Catholics - maybe due to the lasting influence of the dissolved abbey at
Margam and the activities of the priests harboured by the Turbervilles of Sker. Mary Tudor had also been respected by the people of South Wales
since she was seen to be Henry VIII's true heir while Elizabeth was the daughter of the unpopular Anne Boleyn.
Thomas ab Ieuan ap Rees (c.1510-60) was a bard from Tythegston who sang before the dissolution of the monastries - he was a devout Catholic and composed a
verse on the accession of Mary Tudor. One of his other poems tells of his imprisonment in the town of Kenfig.
King Philip of Spain & Margam
There is a story which tells of King Philip of Spain, a suitor for Elizabeth's hand, sending her a gift of orange and lemon trees.
The ship was wrecked on Kenfig Sands but the trees were saved and planted at Margam. They were not formally presented to the Mansels of
Margam until Queen Anne's time and it was not until 1785 that the Orangery was erected for their protection. It is debatable whether the
cultivation of orange trees would have continued in Margam for such a length of time before the orangery was built.

1570 Survey
A survey of the Kenfig Borough in 1570 mentioned several free tenants holding land within the borough.
Richard Thomas held the Grange at Marlas and fifteen burgages in the old town.
Rees Thomas ap Ieuan had a burgage at Millhill.
William Jenkin Armiger held ground at Kenfig Pool.
The annual burgage rent was twenty shillings. Thirty-three shillings and four pence was payable by each burgess when the heir of a deceased lord took possession.
Free tenants and burgesses owed 'suit of court' (an obligation to attend the hundred court and another two yearly courts).
The hundred court was granted by the Crown to a lordship and all free men 'assembled in their hundred'. These tenants were excused
obligations such as suit of mill (having to grind their own corn at the manorial mill) and heriots (payments made to the lord on the death of a tenant).
An ordinance of the Borough added in 1572 descibed the enclosing and ditching of part of the free common at Cefn Cribbwr - this common apparently
extended from Cattpitt (Pwll-y-Gath, Kenfig Hill) to the ridge of Coity. The enclosed land was given to the Borough by the Lords of Glamorgan to
replace ground at Kenfig covered by sand. 29 burgesses shared the area.

LE VAINQUEUR - lost at Sker Rocks on 17 December 1753
On this day in 1753 (260 years ago), the French Merchantman, Le Vainqueur struck Sker Rocks. She was enroute from Lisbon to Le Harve when her
captain entered the Bristol Channel under the belief it was the English Channel, a fatal mistake made by others before and after.
In her holds were 789 chests of oranges, 650 frails of figs, 240 boxes of lemons and 84 planks of Brazilian hardwood. Of her 10 man crew,
8 survived, yet her Captain and the first mate, both brothers were drowned.

Bristol Channel
English Channel
The shameful plundering executed by the local people with much of the cargo destined for the banqueting halls of the French nobility,
was to provide a clandlestine Christmas feast for the people of Margam and Kenfig.
News of her plight spread through the county like wildfire and within hours, hundreds of people were swarming over the stricken vessel
grabbing whatever booty they could. Some hacked at the woodwork and even set it alight in an attempt to recover the nails - everything had salvage value.
The Captain's body was rifled of 17 Portuguese gold pieces, his silver shoe and knee buckles and a silver watch - this last item was recovered from
a Pyle watchmaker to whom the thief had taken it with a view to repair.
Local Arrests
17 people were arrested for looting and several accussed, cited Issac Williams of Sker as having a hand in the plundering of the wreck.
Better known as the father of ' Elizabeth Williams, The Maid of Sker ' -
he was at this time both the Constable for the Hundred of Newcastle and a local magistrate.
He was to claim that he simply removed as much cargo to Sker House as possible to protect it, while this maybe correct, his cause wasn't made
any stronger by the fact that some of these goods were stolen during the night, despite having been put under guard.
During the subsequent enquiry, two witnesses gave statements as to William's conduct and whilst there was insufficient evidence for Williams
to be brought to trial, it is said that local people never trusted him again and that he went in some fear of his life.
The Outcome
Of those arrested, 1 was hanged and to help bring the severity with which the authorities meant to deal with offenders,
notices were affixed to local parish church doors advising, "that the looting of wrecks was punishable by death".
Le Vainqueur
Background Information
Further Information
Le Vainqueur, a French vessel belonging to Harve de Grace was returning home from Lisbon. Her Captain, John Masson made the mistake
of entering the Bristol Channel instead of the English Channel. His ship became stranded at a place called 'ye Scar' - she became
completely wrecked and was extensively looted by crowds of people. When the ship struck, it started to break up quickly. Captain Masson,
his brother, The Mate and a passenger were all drowned. 8 of the crew, however, were saved. An eye witness accounts of a wreck on Sker
Rocks with a crowd of 400 people swarming all over the vessel is noted. It also said that the wreckers tried to set fire to the hull
so that any iron could be recovered.
Wrecking
Many people regarded a wrecked ship as a divine gift - some believed that ships wrecked on those rocks were the right of the local populous.
The authorities were shocked at the wrecking, one officer stated 'that if they had known sooner they could have caught the villans'.
Another report said that when a baliff went to recover some of the cargo an angry mob threatened him with his life. He promptly left
the scene and said he would not return even if he was offered Â£50. Lloyds List summed up the event by saying 'the Country people made a perfect wreck of the Ship and Cargo'.

Arrested at Sker House - 04 December 1678
On this day in 1678 (335 years ago), Father Philip Evans, a Roman Catholic priest was arrested at the home of Christopher Turberville at Sker, Glamorgan.
When he refused to take the Oath of Supremacy, he was imprisoned alone in Cardiff Castle. He had been
arrested in the hysteria of the Titus Oates plot to kill King Charles II.
After five months the priest was brought to trial but when no evidence of his complicity could be produced, he
was charged with being a priest (which was illegal in the realm) - few were willing to serve as witnesses. He was
convicted on the evidence of two poor women who were suborned to say that they had seen Father Evans celebrating Mass.
He was executed on Gallows Field (north eastern end Richmond Road, Cardiff) - Father Evans addressed the onlookers
in Welsh and English - He was executed along with John Lloyd saying 'Adieu, Mr Lloyd, though for a little time,
for we shall shortly meet again '. The feast day of St. Philip Evans is on 25 October.
Father Philips died at Cardiff, 22 July 1679. He was beatified in 1929, canonized by Pope Paul VI in 1970 as one of the Forty
Martyrs of England and Wales.

Background
Philip Evans was born in Monmouthshire in 1645 and educated at Saint-Omer, he joined the Society of Jesus when he was 20 and was ordained at LiÃ¨ge, Belgium, in 1675.
Father Philip was sent back to Wales to minister to the Catholics in the southern part of the country. For several years he zealously ministered to
his flock unmolested, but the civil authorities turned a blind eye until November 1678 - although John Arnold, a justice of the peace and hunter of priests,
offered a Â£200 bounty for his arrest, Father Evans refused to leave his flock untended.

The Seal of Kenfig Borough
The seal was used by Alice, the widow of John Peruat, (former Burgess of Kenfig) for her gifts of land & 2 burgages in the town of Margam Abbey
in 1320 & 1321 because 'her seal is unknown to many persons'.
In August 1325 the seal was used by John Nichol of Kenfig when he quit-claimed to the monks all his land & burgages in the town.
This wasn't the only seal used by the burgesses. John (son of Henry de Bonville) used the Kenfig Borough Seal on a receipt for payment in lieu
of arrears on a pension he was receiving from the monks.
Instead of an ornamental cross between 4 pellets, the seal outlined displays the device of a fleur-de-lis.
The Iron Age
7th Century Iron Age Camp
Pen-y-Castell, Kenfig Hill
This fortification was 700 feet long by 220 feet wide strategically positioned on the crest (Ton) to command
a military position over the 2 valleys either side
& the approaches from the sea. Remains of the camp were extensively damaged by quarrying in 19th century.
A 9th century fortification on Stormy Down were completely destroyed by more recent quarrying during the 20th century.

Kenfig - A Medieval Town
A Brief Background
Archaeological evidence has suggested that there has been a settlement at Kenfig since Roman times. Pieces of Romano-British pottery,
a roofing tile and a coin depicting the emperor Constans (337 Â 350 A.D.) have been found. Additionally, a Roman road runs through the Borough
complete with mile stones. These mile stones are situated in Margam and Pyle and they carry inscriptions to the emperors
Postumus (259 Â 268 A.D.)
and Victorinus (268 - 270 A.D.) respectively. In the wider landscape Neolithic arrowheads, scrapers, a dwelling and a burial urn have also been
uncovered suggesting that Kenfig has been a home to people for at least 4000 years.
The Iron Age
Iron Age settlements were constructed to the North and to the East of Kenfig providing a continuity of occupation into Roman times.
The Iron Age people of Kenfig were known as the Silures and they were led by Bodvoc, son of Caitegern, great-grandson of Eternalis Vedomavus.
Bodvoc was killed in the struggle against Rome by legionaries commanded by
Julius Frontinus. The ÂBodvoc StoneÂ, a tribute to the Silurian leader,
now stands in the Margam stones museum.
The Romans
The Romans were converted to Christianity by the Emperor Constantine in 313 A.D. and the pagan tribes of Kenfig were forced to abandon their
gods and worship the god of Rome. As Christianity took hold among the Silures, and Britain as a whole, monasteries were built, including an early
structure at Margam. To this day, an abbey exists at Margam, thus providing a link to those early Christian founding fathers.
Irish, Angles, Saxons & Vikings
By 410 A.D. the Roman Empire was in decay and the troops stationed in Britain were called back to defend Rome. The vacuum left by the Romans
was filled by numerous raiders over the coming centuries, including the
Irish,
the Angles,
the Saxons and the Vikings. It is suggested that the
Vikings settled in the area and that local place names such as Sker, and Kenfig itself, are of Viking origin.
The Normans
By the 11th century a new power had emerged in Europe: descendants of the Vikings, the Normans
invaded Britain and led by Robert Fitzhamon they
took control of Kenfig, c1100 A.D. A castle was built, initially of wood, to help suppress any local opposition and that was followed by a church,
dedicated to St James. A town was established, made up of Norman and English settlers, and a system akin to apartheid was set in place.
Needless to say, the indigenous people, who were largely excluded from the town, took exception to this imposition and the town was raided on the
13th January 1167. As a result of this, and subsequent raids, the wooden castle was replaced by a stone tower and the donjon that would come to
dominate Kenfig for the next 300 years was born.
