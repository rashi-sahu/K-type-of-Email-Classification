EACH has helped us keep Stanley’s memory alive. And allows us to look to the future
Brad, Stanley's Dad
I can’t imagine what it would have been like. Nobody should have to, every family should be offered the support we were, and are still getting
Claire, Jacob’s mum
We arrived at the hospice feeling scared and alone. We had so many questions – they answered them all and more.
Claire, Jacob’s mum
I really love going to the hospice. I’ve made friends there and get to do loads of fun stuff.
Renee
EACH helps us to create lovely memories and has played an important part in all of our lives, not just Lucy’s.
Heather, Lucy’s mum
I didn’t realise hope was a gift until I became a mum. My little boy taught me many things and that was one of them
Claire, Jacob’s mum
When we first heard about the hospice we were apprehensive because we didn’t know what to expect. When we got there we realised it was a lovely place where Renee would be well looked after, and we would be able to have a much-needed
break.
Stacy, Renee’s mum
It’s been a great opportunity to meet other parents in a similar situation, something that doesn't really happen anywhere else.
Helen, William’s mum
EACH supports families when they’re at their absolute lowest, helping them to come to terms with their child’s illness, losing them and beyond
Brad, Stanley's Dad
Renee loves going to The Treehouse, but it’s great that care staff are also able to visit us at home too.
Stacy, Renee’s mum
The play specialists are excellent and I also get inspiration from the activities they organise.
Heather, Lucy’s mum
Children like Lucy don’t get the opportunity to go to sleepovers or to their friends for tea, so the interaction she has at the hospice is priceless.
Heather, Lucy’s mum
EACH helped us with coping mechanisms and special ways of remembering Stanley.
Brad, Stanley's Dad
We are also supported by the 24/7 True Colours nurses and it’s so reassuring knowing we can call on them whenever we need support or advice
