About EACH
The EACH project is a community collaboration to explore the local heritage and raise awareness of the fascinating history of the Enham charity and Enham Alamein village.
Enham Village Centre opened in 1919 as a place of rehabilitation for injured and disabled servicemen returning from the First World War. The village was renamed Enham Alamein following a generous gift from the Egyptian nation in 1945, in gratitude for the Allied victory at the Battle of El Alamein. We now have a collection of objects, documents and photographs relating to the Alamein campaign and the early days of the Village Centre, which has remained undervalued and underused for the past 90 years.
Thanks to a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, we can now catalogue, conserve and increase public access to this collection, for the benefit of present and future generations of our community.
