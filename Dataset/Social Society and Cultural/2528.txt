Welcome to the website of David Florence, canoe slalom athlete.
3 x OLYMPIC SILVER MEDALLIST – 3 x WORLD CHAMPION
Since my first canoe slalom race in 1997 at the age of 14, I have been persuing excellence in the sport of canoe slalom. Having now been selected to represent Team GB at the Olympics Games is a dream come true. The Olympic Games start on the 8th of August this summer, coincidentally also my Birthday – follow the run up towards the games here on davidflorence.co.uk
David has nothing but commitment, and is able to point his skill to achieve such things as the Olympic and world titles. First of all we really need to say to David Congratulations on the achievements throughout the years, and especially at Rio.
