Gov Changes Affecting Muslim Students
Category: General
As
you may be aware the government made changes to the financial model for
loans taken out to pay for university tuition fees and living expenses.
The changes meant that the new model was entirely based on interest
making it haram for us Muslims. After many Islamic
charities consulted with the government, the government  proposed a
sharia compliant Loan alternative for Muslim Students- but it will only
go through if there is a demand shown before the 12th of June by filling
out a government survey.
