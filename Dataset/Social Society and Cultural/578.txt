Welcome to the Honourable Artillery Company
Welcome to the Honourable Artillery Company, a charity incorporated in 1537.
We have over 2,500 members, many of whom are active in the oldest regiment in the British Army, the Army Regiment that bears our name, or in the Special Constabulary of the City of London Police. Others, having completed their service to Crown and country, belong to our veteran Company, enjoying membership not only of the Company but its many clubs and societies as well as its two ceremonial sub-units, the Pikemen & Musketeers and the Light Cavalry.
Our London home, comprising Armoury House and the Artillery Garden, is a unique and vibrant place and offers an unparalleled venue for corporate, private and sporting events as well as being a place for HAC members to meet, eat and relax.
This is a modern, relevant charity, but one with ancient roots at the heart of the City of London.
The Honourable Artillery Company and ABF The Soldiers’ Charity are delighted to announce that a partnership has been formed between the two organisations to raise vital funds and awareness to support soldiers, former soldiers and their families over the next two years.  We strongly believe that this partnership is an opportunity for the HAC and its members to make a real difference.  A special HAC Just Giving page has been set-up at www.justgiving.com/HACgiving, and we encourage all members to offer their support to the Charity through a donation, so we can get things off to a flying start.  Over the next two years the partnership will be used to help increase awareness of the work of The Soldiers’ Charity to members and to encourage members to fundraise for this vital cause.

Did you know the Drum Room is so called because it once housed a display of the regiment’s drums?… https://t.co/nAdCxppaFP
