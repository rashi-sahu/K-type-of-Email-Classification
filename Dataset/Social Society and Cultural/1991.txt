Our current priorities are to raise money for a new operating table and birthing chair and to equip the hospital with showers, washbasins and additional toilets.

A report of our most recent visit to the Congo can be found here and a video is below.
The East of the Democratic Republic of Congo is still recovering from the African  War 1998 - 2003 in which 5,000,000 people died. In 2007 UK Quakers helped fund completion of a Peace Centre in Uvira and were impressed by the meticulous receipts sent for the work done. Two-way visits followed and, in 2009, UK and E Congolese Quakers formed the Quaker Congo Partnership, based on formal agreements that set out our shared roles and responsibilities for core projects.
We now seek more trustees & associates with experience & enthusiasm to help in this work.
Trustees discern the charity's way  forward. As well as trustees with general skills, we are seeking a clerk or co-clerks with experience of Quaker business method to replace those whose terms of office are ending.
Associates contribute their skills, mostly assessment, research, and translation in small groups which focus on particular projects or aspects of our work: hospital care, trauma counselling, micro-credit and fresh water... or on fund-raising, publicity, risk etc.  They're not final decision-makers but inform the Trustees' discernment.
Interest in rural development in Africa is required. French is helpful but not essential. Quakers and non-Quakers are welcome.
If you would like to explore these roles, please contact Catherine Putz holtomputz@3-c.coop
People in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo continue to suffer immensely from violence, instability and poverty, and natural disaster as well - not least as a result of the calamitous wars in the region since 1998.
The Quakers of CEEACO in eastern Congo are working to rebuild their communities in peace, providing medical care, trauma counselling, income generating opportunities and other initiatives to benefit men, women and children of all religious and ethnic groups.
Please join us in supporting them in their important work.
