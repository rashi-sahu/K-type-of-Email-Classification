About The Forum for Preventing Deaths in Custody
The Forum for Preventing Deaths in Custody exists to learn lessons and effect change to prevent deaths in custody. Unfortunately this is a problem that does occur on numerous occasions across the UK every year. It is important to understand and learn from the factors that cause these types of deaths. Our forum has been set up to share opions, offer advice and help those who have suffered from this. The aim of the forum is to increase learning opportunities. Initially the forum will cover areas of work that fall within the responsibility of Home Office and Department of Health. In practice, this will mean work around deaths of people detained in police custody, prison, approved premises, immigration custody or those detained under the Mental Health Act. Deaths which occur after prison release may also be included in the forum’s scope, as may “near deaths”, both of which can provide important sources of learning.
Forum for Preventing Deaths in Custody publishes opinions and reports soon...
