Marc & Juliet
“I think the key for us is that we were so unified through this whole process, it was another bonding experience because we were going on this journey together. She has not stopped staring at it since and I catch her looking at it all the time.”

First class service and product, couldn’t have wished for better
From initial inquiry to delivery, nothing was too much trouble. After discussion, I was offered options that fitted my budget & expectations & was assured by the process and the simplicity of ordering.
Phil
I cannot recommend this company highly enough
The helpful and dedicated staff helped me through every step of the way in designing my now fiancée's engagement ring. She was delighted and overwhelmed with the beauty and quality of the ring.
Matthew
They make a daunting process very easy!
They make the experience very personal, especially compared to some of the Hatton Garden jewellers who just try to flog you something off their shelves. My fiancée loves the finished ring and I am amazed at how beautiful they were able to make it for my budget.
Owen
First class service!
I can't rate these guys highly enough. Really helpful, knowledgeable, great products and a personal service. Would definitely recommend.
