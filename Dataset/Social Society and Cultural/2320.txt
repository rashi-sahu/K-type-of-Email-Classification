Baseball pays tribute to Robinson
Robinson's number 42 at a baseball stadium on Sunday
American sport has commemorated the 60th anniversary of Jackie Robinson becoming MLB's first black player.
Robinson first played for the Brooklyn Dodgers on 15 April 1947, signalling the end of baseball's colour bar.
The Dodgers now play in LA, and in Sunday's game against San Diego all their players wore Robinson's famed number 42 to honour his memory.
Some 200 players in other games also wore 42, and other sports stars marked the anniversary in their own ways.
Juan Pablo Montoya's No. 42 Nascar vehicle sported a special Jackie Robinson Day sticker, while the NBA's Jerry Stackhouse supplemented his No 42 Dallas Mavericks jersey by writing Robinson's name on his sneakers.
Robinson's number was retired by all Major League Baseball clubs at a special ceremony in New York in 1997.
Jackie would think the struggle is still on and he would not be satisfied with where we are
Rachel Robinson
Sunday's game in Los Angeles was attended by his widow, Rachel Robinson, long-time Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully and MLB commissioner Bud Selig.
Hall of Famers Hank Aaron - the all-time home runs leader - and Frank Robinson - the first black major league manager - threw the first pitches.
Cincinnati star Ken Griffey Jr, who first wrote to Selig asking if he could wear 42 on Sunday, said: "A lot of people wouldn't be in this locker room if it wasn't for what he did."
Florida Marlins pitcher Dontrelle Willis said wearing No. 42 was "the highest honour I've ever received in my life".
He added: "I don't think anybody in this day and age could go through (what Robinson did). Some people are just made for things, and he was."
Robinson, who died in 1972 at age 53, endured racial abuse from fans and fellow players and even death threats after beginning his Brooklyn career.
Rachel Robinson told USA Today that there was still work to be done in eradicating racism from sport and society in general.
"Jackie would think the struggle is still on and he would not be satisfied with where we are," she said.
