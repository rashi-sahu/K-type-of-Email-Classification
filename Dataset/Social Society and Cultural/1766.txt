Making an IMPACT
IMPACT's vision is of a world free from needless disability.  We believe that no one should become or remain needlessly disabled through disease, lack of knowledge or shortage of medical services.
The IMPACT programme, across 11 countries of Africa and Asia, prevents and treats needless disability; improves health; and as a consequence, alleviates poverty.
IMPACT - why, how, who, where?
