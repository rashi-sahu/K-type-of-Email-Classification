Two new booklets were launch at Dementia Congress 2016
Making an Impact Together - draws on the experience of dementia activist groups which are members of the UK-wide DEEP network. The guide covers topics such as setting up a group, finding allies, making change happen and dealing with challenges.It is part of an ESRC-funded project between Innovations in Dementia CIC and ECRED at the University of Edinburgh.
Our Dementia, Our Rights is a new guide which aims to highlight as simply as possible the importance of human and civil rights in ensuring support, inclusion and dignity for people with dementia. It has been co-produced with the Dementia Policy Think Tank, a group of seven people with dementia interested in influencing policy.

Issue 104 features the development of two booklets Making an Impact Together and Our Dementia, Our Rights, and also gives details about how you can get involved in the Reading Friends project

Innovations in Dementia is a community interest company.
We work nationally with people with dementia, partner organisations and
professionals with the aim of developing and testing projects that will
enhance the lives of people with dementia.
Outcomes from such projects will influence approaches to dementia care
and support in order that they are more creative, positive and enabling.
We aim to work collaboratively with people with dementia in all our work.
We provide advice and training to other organisations to help them develop
more positive care and support services for people with dementia.
We believe that people with dementia should:
Be able to experience all that life has to offer
Receive appropriate and sensitive support to access opportunities
and learn new skills
Be part of opportunities and decisions that affect their lives
