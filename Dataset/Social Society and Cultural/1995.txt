Welcome
Quaker Voluntary Action provides practical opportunities to put faith into action and develop ways of volunteering that meet the challenges of our time.
Working Retreats
QVA organises working retreats in Britain, Europe and beyond. Volunteers participate in practical projects and reflective sessions that promote personal spiritual development with meaningful engagement in the world. A range of activities may include gardening, renovation, olive harvesting, decorating, sustainability and woodland management.
Our 2017 programme will be available from end of February. Here is our last year’s QVA Programme
Newsletter
We publish our newsletter early each year which gives reports of the previous year’s projects and articles by our volunteers and facilitators. If you have participated on a working retreat and would be happy to share your experience in our newsletter, please get in touch.
