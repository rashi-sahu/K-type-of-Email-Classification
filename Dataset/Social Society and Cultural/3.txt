As Gove is no longer in the cabinet and our site founder Leila has gone on to more important things we have closed the site for subscription and membership.
We will not be updating for the time being.
But watch out, the new Government seem even more regressive than ever!

Nicky Morgan is Wrong
» by Editor in: Article
[Translate]
The education secretary Nicky Morgan has today launched a bill designed to sweep away any obstacles when as many as 1,000 “struggling” schools convert to academies.
Article in the Guardian that questions the Government’s fixation on Academies as the universal solution to edition, and how a conservative select committee question the Minister’s fixation on removing democratic local control, essentially turning schooling over to commercial interests and thus imposing Tory ideology as a guiding principle in the formation of ideas.
Is this genuinely in the interests of families?
In a comment, Michael Rosen remarked:
Do we really have a government in power (I don’t care if it’s Labour, LibDem or Tory) that has passed legislation which enables our collective property to be ‘transferred’ out of our ownership and control to any of the variety of bodies now running academies – chains, universities, charities etc?
Perhaps I missed it, was this particular matter debated in the House? Did we the people really agree to this?

Private Colleges absorb student loan funds
» by Editor in: News
[Translate]
In this revealing investigation, a reporter enters a private college that receives funding from student loans even if students do not attend.
A large number of enrollees appear to be missing from classrooms.
Have government policies on tuition fees resulted in a huge waste of public funds?
Students who enroll and receive government grants but then do not attend are effectively stealing the free education promised to by the Lib Dems.
Guardian article.

First Academy Chain to Close
» by Editor in: News
[Translate]
An academy chain in charge of running six state schools became the first in the country to fold today – forcing a sudden hunt for new sponsors to take them over.
The Prospects Academies Trust, which runs six schools in Paignton, Bexhill and Gloucestershire, was one of 14 chains told by the Government it could not take on any new schools because of concerns over standards.
