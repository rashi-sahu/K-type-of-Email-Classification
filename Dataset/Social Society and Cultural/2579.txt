WelfareFri 13th Jan, 2017
Following the FRA committee meeting on 4/12/16 and in light of recent publicity surrounding historical sexual abuse at football clubs, the committee clarified that any allegations of a similar nature within the sport of fell running will be taken extremely seriously and investigated appropriately.
We have already liaised with UKA and an update and explanation of his role will be provided by the newly appointed Welfare Officer in the Spring Fellrunner.
Any enquiries should be directed to Ed Gamble (welfare@fellrunner.org.uk)

British Fell RelaysSun 4th Dec, 2016
After the success of the 2016 British Fell relays in Scotland, 2017 will see the relays return to North Wales, hosted once again by Eryri Harriers, on 15th October.
To ensure the continued success of the event as a truly British championship we are keen to have an English venue for 2018.  I am aware there are a couple of clubs who are looking into the feasibility of acting as the host, but at this stage nothing has been confirmed.  If any individuals or clubs are interested in being involved in putting on this great event, please do get in touch with me sarah@srowell.co.uk – either to discuss what is required or to get hold of the event guidelines.
I am sure I am not alone in hoping we can find an English host to continue to great tradition of the event
Disciplinary ActionMon 7th Nov, 2016
At the Langdale Horseshoe Fell Race on 8th October, a runner ran in the race number allocated to another runner. Both runners have been barred from any participation in all races registered with the Fell Runners Association Limited for a period of three months from 8th October.
The FRA Requirements for Runners (the "Runners Rules") 8. Disciplinary Action clearly states
"The FRA may take disciplinary action such as banning a competitor from future races, and your club may also impose sanctions if your actions reflect badly on them.  Absolute’ no-nos’ are quitting a race without telling the Organiser, running in someone else’s vest number, or cheating on the kit requirements.
2017 GB Mountain SelectionMon 24th Oct, 2016
The 2017 GB mountain running selection criteria can now be found under the international page.  Due to the World Championships being held much earlier (end of July) in 2017, the selection policy is different to previous years.  We envisage this being a one off.

2017 Race RegistrationMon 10th Oct, 2016
All 2016 race organisers have been sent information on how to apply for a 2017 race license (previously known as a permit).  If you are a new organiser, or haven't received this information, please contact me.  The closing date for applications for races to be included in the 2017 FRA Handbook is Monday 31st October.

Change to the WV60 championship categories for 2017Tue 27th Sep, 2016
Following the discussion at the 2016 AGM, stimulated by Wendy Dodds and the subsequent polling of women members aged 50+ it has been decided to make a change to the championship categories for 2017 as follows:
Ranking for the WV60 category is to be calculated on points scored in up to 4 of the 6 races to be listed but only one long race will count.
The situation will be reviewed at the end of 2017.Members who participated are thanked for their input.
English Championship A Long RacesTue 20th Sep, 2016
Calling all ROs, Clubs and potential ROs. Could you create an AL race?
We are down to maybe only one or two A long races worthy of being selected outside the Lake District. This is largely due to courses and/or competitor numbers being impeded by conservation work.
We would like the Championships to be representative of all English hill and fell terrain. Maybe you could create a new race or adapt an existing AM or BL? Bring in extra income for your club or worthy cause maybe? Please consider:
A challenging course, worthy of being a Championship counter.
Avoiding high summer, when the Lakes ALs dominate the calendar.
A good “clean” course with no congestion or bottlenecks (particularly at the start).
Good infrastructure; venue facilities, road access, parking.
No severe restrictions on numbers, land access. This will mainly apply in National Parks.
Please consider giving it a go. Thank you.

Annual Presentation Evening in 2017Wed 3rd Aug, 2016
The FRA is looking for a volunteer club to organise the Annual Presentation Evening in 2017. The host club can seek advice from the Championship sub-committee, but for guidance the keyresponsibilities and criteria include;
 To take place ideally on the second Saturday in November
 To provide a large banqueting type facility capable of hosting 150-200 people with the option of hotel accommodation and adequate parking
 Cost per head for 3 course meal/band/disco around £25-£30
 Easy access to rural hills and organisation of a fell race or timed with an existing local one that weekend would be an advantage
 To organise and oversee the whole event and appoint an MC
 To publicise the event (via The Fellrunner, FRA Facebook, etc.)
 All medals will be dealt with by the Championship Co-ordinator
Anyone interested should contact secretary@fellrunner.org.uk in the first instance
Membership AdminThu 25th Feb, 2016
Remember folks if you move house and you want to continue to get your Fellrunner magazines and annual handbook and fixtures calendar, you also need to update your address in SiEntries by clicking on the Edit/Renew button on the left.
I am also getting several queries from members who have noticed payments leaving their accounts and then being returned.  These are invariably old Standing Orders which will no longer work as subs are now collected by Direct Debit.  If this applies to you then you just need tp cancel the old Standing Order with your bank.
Thanks Charmian
