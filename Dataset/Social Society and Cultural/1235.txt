FaceBritain Kids
Welcome to Face Britain, a national project that invited all young people in the UK to submit a self portrait. Over 200 000 artworks were part of a world record attempt and hopefully the biggest online gallery of self portraits in the world. Make your face famous!
Over 200 000 self portraits were submitted to Face Britain.
These were projected onto Buckingham Palace in a unique image of HM The Queen.
We hope this will break the Guinness World Records attempt for ‘most artists working on the same art installation'. Watch this space!
Thank you for taking part!

Submissions for Face Britain have now closed.
You can have a look at the gallery to see all the pictures that were entered.
Even though Face Britain has now closed to new entries, you can still create a self portrait online, at home or in class. Think about how you want to be seen and which materials you will use to create your own portrait. Be creative!

Headline Sponsors
"We’re
delighted to be the headline sponsors of such a wonderful project.  We here at B&Q are extremely proud of our work with
young people. Learning practical skills and realising you have the ability to
complete a hands-on project for yourself is a great confidence boost and is
transferable to all aspects of life. It is also a way to show young people who
are less suited to a traditional, academic approach that they can achieve in
other areas. This is why Face Britain is something that really excites
us; it’s great to be part of a project that’s championing the power of the arts
to help transform children’s lives and is fantastic to see how many young
people have got involved. We look forward to seeing how the project progresses
and will be supporting every step of the way."
