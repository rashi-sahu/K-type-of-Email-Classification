Welcome to the Widecombe-in-the-Moor Website
The Widecombe-in-the-Moor website promotes all aspects of Widecombe and Dartmoor life, past, present and future, for the use of local people, visitors, and all who are interested.
Please enjoy exploring the site.
To view and/or download the latest Parish Link in pdf format, click here.
Click here for the results of the 2016 Christmas Tree Competition.
Dartmoor Christmas Trees: for the first time choose and cut your Christmas tree from the farm in Widecombe Parish or visit the website for details of the shop and other services at Haldon Christmas Tree Centre.
The History Group are seeking your help for their World War I Project.
They are seeking information on the numerous local people who went to fight in the War but have not been remembered.
They are listed here. If you have any information on these or any others, however small, or any other WWI story, please visit the page and get in touch.
We are remembering those from Widecombe that fell during World War One by recording details of their life and war record.
Full details are available here, including those who died in 1915.
We have now completed those who died in 1916: Henry James Broome and Leicester F. Struben.
You can also view the Widecombe Roll of Honour, which lists those from the local area who served in World War One.
This list is being developed as a part of the local Devon Remembers WWI project.
We now have a Community News Page, where items of a local community interest are posted.
Visit the Widecombe Digital Archive with its already substantial quantity of online assets including Apprenticeships, Churchyard Headstones, Tithe Apportionments and other Parish Chest contents including Overseers' Accounts and Churchwardens' Accounts. Phase two (the History Group Archive and other material donated or loaned to the Group) is in progress and a number of these items have also been uploaded to the online archive.
If you have trouble travelling to Widecombe by public transport, this website may help you out. Give www.journeydevon.info a try. In fact it will help you with your travel throughout Devon.
Please take a look at our Google Map of Widecombe Village Centre.
Please Visit the History Group Publications Page to consider buying their publications, including their book 'History of Widecombe Fair'. This book is also available from some local shops.
