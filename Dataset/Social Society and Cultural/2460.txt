CAMBRIDGE SUMMER  MUSIC was founded in 1979. It exists to promote live classical music of the highest calibre in Cambridge and the surrounding villages.
It supports young artists at the beginning of their careers as well as the highest quality soloists, chamber ensembles and orchestras. It brings the works of living composers as well as the best of familiar and less familiar repertoire to both the local community and visitors to our great city.
The 2017 Cambridge Summer Music Festival will take place from 14-29 July.
