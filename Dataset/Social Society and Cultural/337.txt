HUMAN STORIES AND THE EAST INDIA COMPANYMore
PROJECT LAUNCH – 19 MARCH 2015We had a great launch of the project yesterday at the Idea Store Whitechapel. The turnout and the levels of interest were fantastic. The invited speakers introduced the East India Company and talked about many interesting stories associated with its history.  They also discussed about various collections and records of the East India Company. Two historical fiction writers shared their experiences of writing historical fiction. We look forward to receiving many applications, from a wide range of individuals from our diverse communities, to become volunteer heritage interpreters / historical fiction writers for the project.
Who should apply to volunteer?Ordinary members of London’s diverse communities, with a special focus on people living in East London, and from different walks-of-life, are invited to apply. This project is particularly suitable for individuals who are interested in developing their knowledge on the heritage of East India Company and skills in creative writing. We are not looking for professional or established historians or writers to join the project. Please click for information, an application form and work plan. Closing date: Monday 20 April 2015.
This initiative was part of a project ran by Brick Lane Circle called the Battle of Plassey Young People's Project, developed to encourage more research and learning about the shared past of Britain and Bengal / Bangladesh - funded by Heritage Lottery Fund. Three of the eight young researchers attended the event to collect the award if successful.
