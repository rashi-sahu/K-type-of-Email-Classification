How The New ESTA Visas Can Save Time And Make Travel Easier
The US now has a new Visa that is designed to make travel easier to and from certain countries. It is called the Electronic System for Travel Authorization or ESTA visum for short. The travelers from the eligible countries are now required to apply for this visa rather than other types like the business B-1 or tourist visas. This is in order to quicken the pace of applications and travel to the US. Those that are entering by land, however, are not required to have this visa. Only travelers by air or sea will need to apply.
The ESTA Visa Takes The Place Of The Others
Technically the ESTA Visa is a waiver of the normal visa and those that are traveling by air or sea will no long have to apply for visas to the US. You can get travel authorization in less than 72 hours before your travel time and it can be done over the Internet on a US.Gov website for convenience.
You still will need a valid passport that is readable by the electronic readers that are at the airport on arrival. All new passports meet this requirement already, but if you an old one you should check to be sure. Only certain countries are in the ESTA system so only those are eligible for the waiver, all other countries must apply for the regular visa and be accepted as usual.
Since the Electronic System for Travel Authorization is only good for up to 90 days, if you plan on visiting for a longer period of time you will need to apply for the standard visa, either tourist, business, or educational. Work is not permitted on this type of visa at all. Plus, most people will have to be fingerprinted or submit some other type of biometric ID on the fist visit. This is to prevent terrorism, fake passports, and identity theft for foreign sources.
People With Dual Citizenship Don’t Need One
If you have dual citizenship with the US and some other country you won’t need this visa at all. But, if you have dual citizenship with an eligible country and a non-eligible country you will need to use your passport from the eligible country to apply and also on entry to the US. Otherwise, if you want to enter using your non-eligible country visa, you’ll need to apply for the standard visa and be accepted.
The new Electronic System for Travel Authorization Visas are faster to obtain and easier to use than the old visa system. If you are from an eligible country, the first visit will take a little longer, but subsequent visits will be faster and with less hassle than usual.

What Is a Kanada eTA And Do You Need to Get One Before You Travel?
Anytime you travel internationally, there are certain documents that are required to enter foreign countries. In the case of Canada, you may be required to obtain an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA).
In essence, a Kanada eTA is a special type of authorization that is directly linked with your passport. Canadian officials require foreigners from most countries entering Canada without a visa to obtain this authorization. The only exceptions are American citizens who are entering the country by sea or by land. They are not required to get an eTA. However, visitors from the U.S. who are flying into the country do need to obtain one.
You can apply online through the official website. All that you need is your passport, a credit card, and some basic personal information. The application process simply involves filling out a form and submitting it. The cost for the authorization is currently $7.00 CAN, although that is subject to change over time.
Once your eTA is approved, it is automatically linked to your passport electronically. Each eTA is good for five years or until your passport expires, depending on which comes sooner. After it expires, you can simply apply for a new one if you still need access to Canada.
One of the nice things about this type of authorization is that there is no need to print anything or to carry any additional documents with you. Instead, the authorization will automatically show up when your passport is scanned since the two documents are linked together.
If you are planning on flying to Canada, it is important to apply for this authorization as soon as possible. You may not be allowed to fly without it if you arrive at the airport and have not yet obtained it. There are last-minute application opportunities available online if you have access to the Internet with a mobile device. However, it is always best to be properly prepared so that you don’t wind up running into any trouble that could delay your travel plans.
A Kanada eTA is a special type of travel authorization that is required by the Canadian government for anyone who is entering Canada without a visa from foreign countries. The only exception is the United States. Citizens traveling from the U.S. only need an eTA if they are entering the country by air – not by sea or by land.
