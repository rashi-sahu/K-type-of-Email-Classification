Our campaign on benefits
Support from benefits can give people help to live with independence and dignity.
However, many of you have told us that you aren’t getting the support you need or being treated fairly and with respect, because of a lack of understanding about mental health and negative stereotypes of people on benefits.
That is why we are campaigning for a fairer benefits system that better understands and supports you. We need your help to make this ambition a reality.
Below you will find information about the different issues we campaign on. Each section will explain our ongoing work as well as give you a chance to get involved and help us campaign for change. You will also find information on where you can find help and support as well as links to our most recent news stories.
"People should be nurtured through a situation when they're not feeling well instead of having to battle"
Back-to-workMainstream back-to-work schemes for people with mental health problems simply aren’t working. We need a new programme with person-centred, specialist support that understands people with mental health problems.

SanctionsWe think people with mental health problems should be supported rather than threatened with sanctions. That is why we are campaigning to make benefits sanctions fairer for people with mental health problems.Find out more >
PIPThe Government is replacing Disability Living Allowance (DLA) with the Personal Independence Payment (PIP). We are campaigning to make sure the new benefit works for people with mental health problems.Find out more >
The WCAYou told us too many of you are receiving poor and inaccurate assessments.
This is having a negative impact on your health and means you don’t get the right kind of support. We are campaigning for improvements to the WCA so that it is more fair and effective for you.
