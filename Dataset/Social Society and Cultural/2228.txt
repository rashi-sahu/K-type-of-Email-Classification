FEMCIT explores the relationship between the changing forms and practices of gendered citizenship in a multicultural Europe and the demands and practices of contemporary women’s movements. We are studying how citizenship is gendered, and how women, as ordinary citizens and activists, have been involved in challenging inequalities and injustice across Europe.
