Things to do
Blackwell Arts & Crafts
The Arts & Crafts movement was a direct response to the Industrial Revolution and championed the skills and vision of craftsmen and women.
When entering Blackwell you will be seeing the very details that the Holt family would have seen over 100 years ago; you will look out over the lawns and Lake to the same magnificent views of the Coniston Fells and experience the tranquil atmosphere that the family would have loved.
