When you educate a girl, everything changes
All of our programs begin with an individual girl in rural Africa. We look at the world from her perspective, and work with communities to dismantle the barriers to her education, and to a life of independence and leadership.
Alice
CAMA Leader, Zambia
Vumilia
Secondary scholar, Tanzania
Mildred
Secondary scholar, Ghana
Dafuloza
Primary scholar, Malawi
Through the education and empowerment that Camfed provides, these resilient girls and young women are transforming their lives, and the lives of many other vulnerable children in their communities.

Give the gift of education
When you educate a girl in Africa, everything changes. She’ll be three times less likely to get HIV/AIDS, earn 25% more income and have a smaller, healthier family.
