Welcome to ProMo-Cymru
ProMo-Cymru works towards building positive change and lasting relationships between individuals, families and communities. We provide innovative and creative solutions through meaningful conversations and digital technology. We believe in co-operation, communication and engagement, and have been doing it successfully for over 30 years.
Communication & Engagement
Everything starts with a conversation. We facilitate continual dialogue with you and your audience, from inception to the final product and beyond. We are experts in community and audience engagement with even the hardest-to-reach groups.
Innovation & Enterprise
Our track record of creating leading innovative projects means we are approached time and again to deliver increasingly demanding solutions. We respond by breaking the mould and exploring new ventures. Every client is unique so no two project outcomes are ever the same.
Co-operation & Partnership
We empower people to envision the future they want and have a voice, bringing them together to make a difference and achieve common goals. Our cooperative principles have been central to our work for over 30 years, with all of our profits invested back into community projects.
Knowledge & Skills
We equip you with the skills, knowledge and confidence to connect with your audience, with a focus on sustainability and taking ideas to the next level. Our experienced trainers and consultants have the expertise to bring the right tools to your project, ensuring everyone is involved every step of the way.
