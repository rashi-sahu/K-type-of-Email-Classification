Spending Cuts and Wholly Living
Christians are calling on the Government not to withdraw funds from Christian services which care for the most vulnerable in society, following the Comprehensive Spending Review.
The Review outlines how the Government is to cut spending by £83bn by 2015.  Following the emergency budget in June that set out how much the country's belt needed tightening, the latest announcement sets out how much each department gets and a broad overview of what will be cut to make the planned savings.
Apart from International Development and Health, all departments have seen their budgets cut, ranging from 3.4 percent for the Department of Education, to a 41 percent cut in administration spending for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport.
The Comprehensive Spending Review allows the Government to plan its expenditure across a number of years, and in the process of this review departments have examined their spending to work out what they will keep and what is now considered unnecessary or unaffordable.
Some of these spending changes are already clear - for example, there will be a significant reduction in funding for Housing Benefit. In many other areas, such as schools and hospitals, the implication of this review will take time to become apparent.  The aim has been to protect frontline services; however, with such large cuts planned services will undoubtedly be lost.
The Evangelical Alliance has called for the Government to ensure that the vulnerable are protected. Speaking in response to the cuts, General Director Steve Clifford said: "The church already is, and must continue to be, a place of shelter for those most in need.  I hope that in spite of these cuts the Government still supports the incredible, and cost saving, community worked by Christian groups across the country."
In response to the economic recession, the Alliance launched the Life Beyond Debt campaign in 2009.  This on-going project aims to advise and inform churches on how to better support its members and local community who are facing hard times as well as help prevent and deal with debt.
In spite of the cuts, Steve Clifford went on to say: "We support the Government's plans to protect, and increase, spending on overseas aid. It is essential that even in very difficult economic times we do not forget our responsibility to the poorest in the world."
Earlier this month, a report was published by three Christian organisations saying that relationships rather than money are the key to happiness.  Wholly Living was produced by Tearfund, CAFOD and the public theology thinktank Theos and examined human wellbeing in both UK and International Development contexts and sought to spark a debate on how best to create an environment that promotes human flourishing.
One of the areas facing the deepest cuts is the Ministry of Justice, which has responsibility for prisons. Rev Steve Robinson from Langley House Trust, a Christian ministry that runs 17 rehabilitation homes for ex-offenders across England, said: "The knock-on effect is still unknown. We fear that local authorities will be pressured to reduce or remove funding from the less 'popular' groups that we serve.
"The men and women who come to the Trust have a less than one per cent re-conviction rate, compared to the national average of around 60 percent. Any cuts to our budget are therefore of serious concern to wider society."
The principle argument of the report is that political and economic thought, especially as it relates to international development is 'founded on an inadequate and ultimately harmful vision of what it means to flourish'.
Polling released in conjunction with the report backed up the conclusion that people are most fulfilled when they are productive, creative and have strong relationships with others.  Of those polled, 97 percent said that time with friends and family was important to achieve happiness, while 64 percent felt a high income would achieve the same.
