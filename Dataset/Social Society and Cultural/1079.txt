The Vegan Family House went online in 1998, back when the internet felt new, before blogs and Google and RSS feeds. It‚Äôs had to move and change.
The best bits of the site and the blog are now situated here among the trees:¬†recipes,¬†books,¬†photos, thoughts on life‚Ä¶¬†more will be added as we go along.

I find your blog quite interesting. Love the recipes. Must say, I dream of a life as calm and surrounded by nature as you and your family have. Where in Scotland do you live? Blessings!

I too crave a life like yours. I recently moved to university in a big city and although I enjoy the course and have lovely friends, I miss being out in the countryside‚Ä¶.

Well, fit like and foo‚Äôs it gaun wi ye? Given we are living in central Italian countryside it is difficult (practically impossible ‚Äì esp with 2 kids in state school) to be vegan but we try to be ‚Äòdairy reducers‚Äô . I was looking for some decent vegan recipes for nut roast and gin ah wis fair taken aback tae fin a site fae back hame living the dream (don‚Äôt puncture, please). Just wanted to say thank you and hello.

What a wonderful blog you have. My only complaint is that I live on the other side of the pond and we don‚Äôt get all the lovely chocolates you talk about. : )
I lived in Aberdeen for a short time after University. Sometimes I wish I still lived in Scotland ‚Äì but alas, if I didn‚Äôt leave I wouldn‚Äôt have gotten together with my husband and, well, the rest is history.

That‚Äôs how it goes isn‚Äôt it? The people we love are more important than any geographical location anyway üòÄ or anything really‚Ä¶

Hi ‚Äì just wanted to thank you all for creating this fantastic resource. We are a vegan family with two kids aged 4 and 6 living in Wiltshire and don‚Äôt know any other vegans so it‚Äôs great to have the benefits of all your knowledge at our fingertips. Love all the kids stuff too ‚Äì you are such a cretive lot. Do you happen to know of any vegan family groups online ‚Äì would love to link up and chat with others living similar lifestyles.

Hi Isla, glad you find the site useful. I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm a bit out of touch with things for younger children now, did used to run such a group but it is no more. There is (or was) the vegan families list from the vegan society ‚Äì you can contact them at http://www.vegansociety.com

I am a massive fan of your site, ever since I found it and fell in love with it when I went vegan back in 2001. I‚Äôm a Scot in exile ‚Äì love living in Bristol but Scotland rocks my heart on so many levels. The positivity, creativity and gorgeous scenic photos of this site make me go all thumb-sucky! I‚Äôm sure you and your family know how lucky they are ‚Äì but you share so much of your lives. Thank you! I often recommend this and the Frugal UK to people as they are so practical and inspirational.

Yay a fellow scots vegan. I crave the woods living life. We are currently moving out of our flat into my mums place with our wee girl to save money and buy somewhere in the future.
We don‚Äôt have a car or anything so I don‚Äôt think we could have the woods life unfortunately . Love the blog

We started out in a flat too, so you never know! And some woods are close to villages/towns/bus routes‚Ä¶ Glad you like the site üôÇ

Wow, I found your blog back in 2006 when I first went vegan, if I remember correctly the two children were home schooled? Since 2006 I‚Äôve gone on to create my own vegan food business and today while searching for new vegan blogs yours popped up again, amazing! So pleased its all still here, your recipes are lovely, proper home style cooking, best wishes to you all.
