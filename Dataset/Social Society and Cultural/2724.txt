Kielder Water and Forest Park - The official visitor website | Kielder Water and Forest Park
Welcome to the greater outdoors.
Kielder Water & Forest Park brings you nature on a grander scale. The views are bigger, the night sky brighter, the sports wilder and the smiles wider. We’re home to the biggest man-made lake in Northern Europe and, at over 250 square miles, the largest working forest in England. The best way to explore Kielder is to start at one of our three visitor centres, Tower Knowe, Kielder Waterside or Kielder Castle. So what are you waiting for? Follow these directions to get here and get ready for the greater outdoors made just for you.
