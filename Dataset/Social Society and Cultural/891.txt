A great destination In the heart of the Test Valley
"Set in the Test valley in Hampshire, Wherwell and the surrounding countryside has stolen many hearts over the years"
The VillageWith it's many classical thatched cottages, and idyllic green English country side Wherwell is a sight to behold, especially in the summer. Wherwell is a village on the River Test in Hampshire, England. The name may derive from its bubbling springs resulting in the Middle Ages place name “Hwerwyl” noted in AD 955, possibly meaning “kettle springs” or “cauldron springs.” Pronunciation of the name has ranged from “Hurrell” to “Wer-rel” to present-day “Wher-well". The WebsiteOriginally set up in 2002 by Richard Rowles. Richard has lived in the Test Valley and Wherwell for most of 40 years, as have 4 generations of his family.
