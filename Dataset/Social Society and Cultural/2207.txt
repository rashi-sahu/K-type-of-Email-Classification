Introducing
the life and work of Alan Macfarlane and
his collaborators.
He
taught at the Department
of Social Anthropology Cambridge University for thirty-four years
and is now Emeritus Professor of Anthropological Science and a Life
Fellow of King's
College, Cambridge.
As
an anthropologist and historian he has worked on England, Nepal, Japan
and China.
He
has focused on a comparative study of the origins and nature of the
modern world.
In
recent years he has become increasingly interested in the use of visual
material in teaching and research.
(See
some of his uses of the internet.)
This
site contains a wide variety of materials in order to test the potentials
of the web.
The
films and photographs have been made with the permission of the subjects
and are shown here on a "not for profit" basis. We hope that
if you download any you will use them for educational and research purposes
only.

film clips are in QuickTime format. If you do not have QuickTime, click
