Luxury, Four Star Boutique Hotel in the heart of Northern Ireland’s Causeway Coast
One of Ireland’s most well known, luxurious four-star hotels, The Bushmills Inn is situated in an enviable location a stone’s throw from a host of visitor attractions including Royal Portrush Golf Club, Old Bushmills Distillery, The Giant’s Causeway, Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge and Dunluce Castle. Roaring peat fires, nooks and crannies and a secret library set the tone. In the bar, still lit by gas light, try a glass of malt from the hotel’s private cask and make sure to sample some of the finest North Antrim produce in the AA Rosette restaurant.
