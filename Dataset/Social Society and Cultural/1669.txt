Exchange Supplies privacy policy
Exchange Supplies is an organisation with its foundations in the provision of confidential healthcare to a patient group who care more about their confidentiality than any other - injecting drug users.
So you know we really mean it when we say we take your privacy, and right to confidentiality, very seriously. We dispatch goods to individuals in plain packaging.
We do, of course, collect information about you when you give it to us on the phone or through the website. When placing an order you will be required to supply your credit card or bank details but these will only be stored until your order has been despatched. We can only access these again by logging onto a secure server to assist us should there be a dispute with your payment. We respect your privacy and will not divulge data you supply to us for payment and delivery of goods without your permission, all data is stored in accordance with the Data Protection Act.
Cookies
As with virtually all online shops, our shopping basket system relies on the use of cookies. A cookie is normally sent by a web server to you and enables the server to collect information back from your site visit. This information might assist us with collating statistics about sales and traffic patterns for our own use. None of this information will identify individuals.
We have taken all reasonable care to protect your data and our system. Of course, if someone were to break into our password protected system and steals or corrupts data, that is a criminal act, they will be liable for their actions and not us.
Should you require any further information about this or any other of our policies, please do not hesitate to contact us - click here for our full contact details.
Discreet packaging
Exchange Supplies is an organisation with our roots in the provision of confidential drug services, and we absolutely understand the need for discretion in the outer packaging of our goods when shipping to individual customers.
If you tick the discreet packaging tick box your order will be shipped in plain packaging, looking just like any other mail order package. There will be no branding, stickers, logos, or stamps on the outside that would enable someone to guess what the contents are. For UK orders we usually use Royal Mail tracked service as this is likely to draw less attention than an orange TNT lorry.
Overseas orders may have to contain a customs notification declaring the contents.
Exchange Supplies returns policy
By placing an order online, you are committing to buy the products you have selected.
If we supply you with incorrect (or faulty goods) please get in touch straight away so we can correct our mistake and supply the correct product(s).
Your assistance in returning the goods sent in error will be required, and we will, of course, cover the agreed associated shipping costs. We will normally arrange collection, or ask you to post the goods back by recorded delivery. If you choose to return goods using any other method, we reserve the right to only refund what it would have cost us to arrange collection by our courier.
...If after delivery you want to cancel the order, please contact us so we can discuss the practical arrangements for returning the goods. We are an ethical business, and strive to offer the highest levels of customer service but we have to reserve the right, at our discretion, to:
charge a restocking fee;
not refund outbound carriage costs (based on the actual cost to us); and
make you pay for return of the goods in a saleable condition.
Exchange Supplies Terms & Conditions for customers, and use of our website and its contents
Customers
The price payable for the goods is that as set out at the time you place your order and should coincide with those prices listed within the website. VAT, where applicable, is included in all prices displayed online. We reserve the right to adjust these prices without warning or prior notice. Errors and Omissions are unlikely because the webshop is integrated with our accounts system, but we have to stipulate that they are excepted (E&OE).
Some customers are exempt from VAT, the prices given in a web order may still show VAT, however, this will be deducted prior to dispatch.
We strongly recommend that you use a delivery address that is generally occupied during normal working hours (Monday to Friday, 09.00 to 17.30). If we have to organise redirection of your goods once dispatched, or pay for the goods to be returned to us, we reserve the right to pass on any additional costs to you.
We will not be liable for any return postage costs unless the goods are dispatched faulty or the incorrect items are sent to you.
If you are unhappy with any goods we supply, please call us on 01305 262244 and we will endeavour to resolve your complaint quickly.
Your order will not be dispatched until we have received clearance from your credit card company.
If all or any of your order is not ready for dispatch we will not take any money from you until the goods are ready to go.
If you select a free, non-tracked, delivery service please note that we cannot be held responsible for items that do not arrive. We have had a number of customers repeatedly claim non-delivery, and the cost of replacing goods claimed to be lost was getting out of control, so we have had to revise our terms and conditions to make it clear we do not replace items sent free of charge by second class post.
Please also see our returns, privacy and delivery policies.
