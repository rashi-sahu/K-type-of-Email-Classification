Hackney’s Pre-Olympic Anti-Sex Campaign…
17
Nov
The gentrification of London borough Hackney has accelerated in the run-up to the Olympics, which has resulted in some very good things; more community support on the streets, reduction in violent crime, sports funding for young people. The actual event itsself may or may not be a disaster…
Hackney Council’s newest and most discussed policy is a complete ban on lap-dancing clubs, sex shops, erotic cinemas and all other sites of ‘sexual entertainment’.
Their proposed policy and online questionnaire can be found here. Have your say.

Wow, starting to sound more and more like puritanical America. Sorry.

We’re just reporting on it so that people can have their say in either direction – we’re certainly not anti-sex!
