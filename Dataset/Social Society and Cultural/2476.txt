Britain's Greatest Ever Female Skier

Almost 4 weeks ago when our baby boy was born, Dougie and I decided to use Future Health Biobank to help us store Locki's cord blood cells. There were so many reasons why we opted for this insurance policy we hope to never use. I have personal experience on how this treatment could have helped me throughout a few of my big injuries as a professional athlete. The fact is that Lochlan's mum and dad both spent many years throwing themselves down the mountain, charging and pushing their limits. Knowing our son will likely follow in our footsteps in some way or another means as his parents we want to support and protect him as much as we can. So opting to bank his cord blood cells means that we know we are giving him every chance physically in life to overcome adversity should he need it. We were so impressed by Future Health's professionalism and the phlebotomist they sent when i gave birth was both incredibly efficient and empathetic to the emotions we were going through in the last stages of birth and I hardly noticed her presence at all. We chose them because they seem to be the worlds best and have really good reviews and help protect Locki's samples by storing them in multiple locations around the world. I am writing this because so many people were interested in the reasons we opted to do this and I can't recommend Future Health enough!

What a prize! Thanks Guys
Today marks the start of the one weekend in the year where we spend hours shopping online and queuing outside shops to hunt for the best deals in the shopping frenzy known as #BlackFriday. But did you know that next Tuesday (Nov 29th) is #GivingTuesday?
#GivingTuesday is a worldwide initiative that encourages everyone to show their support for their favourite charity on one day, straight after Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and I'll be supporting the charity I am patron for: Snow-Camp!
Snow-Camp makes winter sports accessible to a whole new audience of young people who never thought that they would have the opportunity to learn how to ski or snowboard. I have always strived to make skiing available to all and Snow-Camp is really achieving that by working with inner-city young people at artificial slopes in the UK. Not only do the young people learn a new sport but they also work towards nationally recognised qualifications too!
If you buy one less toy or one less item of clothing this weekend and donate the money to Snow-Camp instead, it could really make a huge difference and this is one charity definitely worth supporting!

#ChemmysChristmasComp is really gathering momentum. Every few days I will be doing a Facebook prize description.
Today's highlight is on my newest Sponsor/Ambassador role with Chel-Ski - aka London's Best Urban Mountain.
From the first time I saw the architectural alpine masterpiece in the heart of south west london I loved the place. I went as a customer looking for somewhere to develop my niece's passion for the skiing whilst she was at home away from mountains. Seeing her confidence explode as she used the mirror at the base of the slope to improve her body position whilst being directed by her supportive, friendly and knowledgable instructor showed me the power of the huge rotating treadmill.
I was really keen to come on board as an Ambassador to support and highlight this great indoor ski centre, so I am really thankful that this opportunity to ski at Chel-Ski with me as your coach is something that YOU could win in this Christmas Comp.
Some competition info:
Chel-Ski is London's newest and largest indoor ski centre - located right in the heart of Chelsea - that opened its doors in December 2015. Chel-Ski offers a fun, safe and controlled environment where you can take your very first steps into the fun-fuelled world of skiing and snowboarding or brush up on existing skills. Chel-Ski offers superb facilities including the very best hi-tech slopes " revolving astro turf mats " that can be adjusted in terms of angle and speed.
The prize includes use of one slope for one hour, tuition and supervision provided by Chemmy herself, and supply of boots, skis / snowboards and helmets.
Don't forget to retweet and favourite on twitter and like and share on facebook with a chance to be in with a chance to win these amazing prizes.
