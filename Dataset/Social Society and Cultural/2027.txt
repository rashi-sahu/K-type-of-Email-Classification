An Oral History
Over its more than 40-year history, Runnymede has participated in some of the most important events and developments in race relations and tackling racism in the UK – from consulting on legislation, reporting on and analysing the causes of civil disturbances, to recording major and ongoing changes in the demography of Britain.
This website tracks the key moments in the struggle for race equality between 1968 and 1988 through archival research and audio interviews recorded with some of the major figures in Runnymede's history and, therefore, the history of race relations in Britain. We invite you to navigate through history - via the timeline and article menu on the left, or via the tag cloud on the right – and explore the events that have shaped race relations in the UK.
In the future, we hope to continue with the second part of Runnymede's history, taking you up to the present day. You can, though, begin your journey with Dipak Nandy, Runnymede's first Director, talking about how the organisation started. Just click on the audio interview on the right.
