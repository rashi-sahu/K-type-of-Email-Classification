Welcome to Sociological Research Online
We publish fully peer-reviewed sociology looking at current issues. A purely online journal, we make use of new media and reach a wide and international readership. We also publish special sections and rapid response articles, which address key issues in the public arena. Articles can be submitted online.
Sociological Research Online welcomes proposals for special sections from prospective guest-editors. There is guidance on how to write a proposal.
The review editors would like to hear from early career sociologists who are interested in reviewing books for the journal. Please submit your details to socres@surrey.ac.uk.
Author analysis of select articles is available at our blog.
