Latest Update: 19th February 2017
Schooling
On this day in Winteringham ....1841: A letter appeared in the Stamford Mercury, referring to some very accomplished brickwork.  The correspondent thought it so good that it must have been a sample of "the Winteringham bricklayer."  (It apparently was not, in this instance.)
1886: Walter Bell, sailor, was fined £1, with £1-4s costs when found guilty of assaulting PC Everitt.
1921:
For using a very lame horse for work in a turnip field, William Sutton was fined £1, and his farmworker 2s 6d.1925:
The Diarist reported on 4 whist drives held in February 1925!  Of these one named “Jimmie Sewells Whist drive” raised the most cash (£15).  The same diarist had reported that Jimmie had his foot cut off in a farm accident the previous 6th December.
The Grocer
and Draper’s shop you have in your High Burgage photos, used to be my ggg grandfather’s in the late 1830s-early 1840s. He was William Kirk born
around 1810 (outside Lincolnshire) and died around 1846 (probably Hull) His wife Ann(Fox) died 1835 and he re-married to Martha Horner. He had a son John born
1833 in Burringham.Do you have any suggestions as to where I can find more information on William e.g place of birth.
I am interested
in anything and everything to do with Mill/Mills in Winteringham and North Lincs. My name is Michael WINN, I am a direct relative of Mary Ann Judge (nee
WINN)and her husband Charles Judge.Mary was indeed born in Blyton, she was baptised on 13th Sept. 1811, and her father Robert Winn built the Mill at Blyton
in 1825. She also had a brother Robert Lightfoot and a sister Elizabeth.Her father Robert also had a brother William, Alkborough Mill, a brother Thomas at
Glentham Mill, and a brother John at Tealby Water Mill.Mary Ann Judge had 7 children, Martha, Robert, Charles, Joseph, William, Mary and Sarah. You will by
now have guessed that I am tracing the "WINN" Family Tree.On
my Tree I also have a marriage in Winterton in 1799 between a Sarah Codd and William WINN and a marriage in 1824 between a Mary Naylor and William
WINN.Someone in your article was also interested in Grasby? Robert Winn's father, John Winn married a Mary Grasby in Caenby in 6th Nov.1760, Mary was
baptised in Thimbleby in 1723.Also in the article you stated that in 16th Nov. 1943 Herbert Clayton sold Mill House for £450 on16th Nov 1905, advert for
the purchase of fixed machinery and Plant at Winteringham Roller flour Mill.  Any more details of the above would be welcome.If you could send me a
copy of your article and any drawings/sketches/photos etc. appertaining to the same and/or any thing on any other Lincs Mills would be greatly appreciated
It may be Hull City of Culture 2017, but the same year marks Winteringham’s own
historic year - 700 years since the charter awarding a market each Wednesday and
an annual fair.  There is now an accurate translation of the charter, and it is intended
to have a calligrapher make a copy to be kept in the parish for posterity!  Knights
and minstrels are already booked for the event!  Keep an eye on this website, or on the special Winteringham Festival website for further details (click here for the Festival website).

to the benefit of the Temperance Society,    On Wednesday evening Mr Robt. Brown, jun., F. S. A.,  gave in the Temperance Hall, by special
request, a lecture  on " Parliamentary Representation, Past and Present."  The lecturer, in his usual interesting style, traced the
history of the House of Commons and its electors from  the earliest times, and said that down to the year 1429, in  the reign of Henry VI., the House
of Commons was elected by the resident householders of England, so that household suffrage in counties is no innovation, but merely a return to the ancient law
of the country. The  lecturer then alluded to the evil effects of a highly restricted franchise, gave some amusing instances of proceedings in the famous
"rotten boroughs," referred to  equal representation under Cromwell, to the vain attempt  of Pitt to reform the House of Commons in 1782,
and to  the Reform Acts of 1832 and 1867, and concluded with an eloquent appeal to those who would hereafter receive the  franchise to exercise it
well and worthily. At the close a unanimous vote of thanks was accorded to the lecturer, and the proceedings closed with a similar compliment to  the
chairman, Mr W. N. Marshall. February 21st 1906Jabez Spencer was sent to prison for begging at Roxby.  He had said that he was tired of living

for any sale was given.February 25th 1881THE PROPOSED RAILWAY BETWEEN BRIGG AN D LINCOLN. 'The following correspondence appears in a
contemporary : - Sir, - May I express a hope that the promoters of this scheme may be induced to consider the propriety of extending the proposed scheme, so as
to continue their line from Brigg alone; the Carrs in a northerly direction? The Ancholme banks afford a straight level line from Brigg to Ferriby Sluice, and
I should imagine it would be greatly to the advantage ofthe few large proprietors who own those banks to make them over as a free gift to the Railway
Company, on the sole condition of accommodation being provided for the different villages. A line such as I have suggested, would pass throng the parishes of
Elsham, Worlaby, Bonby, Saxby,  Horkstow, and Ferriby. The coal traffic to those villages as well as the transport of agricultural produce and farming
requisites would be considerable, and the same line would afford equally convenient accommodation to Broughton, Appleby, Roxby, Winterton, and Winteringham,
that is if the stations were arranged with due care. A line thus made would open out a large tract of country and a considerable population, now almost
destitute of railways.  It would be obviously a wise course to extend the line from Ferriby along the Humber bank to Barton, and then connect it with Hull
or Grimsby, via New Holland.  I enclose my card, but subscribe myself - C.W.M..Sir, - A letter appeared in Tuesday's Lincolnshire Chronicle signed
"C.W.M.", advocating the extension of the above across the Carrs in a northerly direction, Which must end at Ferriby Sluice by reason of coming in
contact with the Humber.  Now, the proposed line would run through the parishes named, but, in each instance, the railway station would be a great
distance from the villages. If the proposed line from Lincoln was to join the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway at Scawby, and then continue
northwards through Scawby village, Broughton village, Appleby village and to Winterton, it would be of great service, and would give direct communication to a
large number of the now isolated inhabitants with Lincoln. Not only would this be the  case, but a junction would be formed with the Trent and Ancholme
Railway at Appleby, thus giving communication with Hull, Grimsby, &c. ,  on the one side, and Doncaster, Frodingham, &.c., on the other. - A line
of this description would be of immense advantage to the district as well as commercially.-Yours, &C., M. W.February 25th 1901The Elizabeth
arrived in Hull Victoria Dock from Winteringham.February 25th 1910"I do not want to harm the woman.  I said I would not.  I cannot
kill anything.  I cannot do it.  I don't kill flies.  Should a moth fly into the house, my wife must kill it; I cannot.  I can bring my
father and my mother, and my four brothers and my three sisters, and my uncle and my aunts, and my cousins, to prove that I am a man of peace.  I am not a
man of blood at all.  I never hurt anybody in my life."  These were the words used in the Scunthorpe police-court on Friday by Walter Herbert
Robinson, law clerk, who was arrested on a warrant for threatening his wife Martha Elizabeth, at Winteringham and he was remanded in custody until Monday, so
that he could, as he desired, bring witnesses, "who knew that he was anything but a murderous man."  The facts were that on Wednesday his wife,
who has property, applied at the Court for a separation order, and, after giving evidence of frequent desertions, and the fact that she had kept him for yen
years, was awarded a maintenance order of 5s per week, but no separation.  Prisoner, who had been a law clerk in Birmingham, went to her shop at
Winteringham on Thursday afternoon, and forced himself in.  Mrs Robinson was then talking to ex-police Inspector Andrews, of Sheffield, who was
negotiating for her business.  Defendant then said he should have killed her years ago, and said he would kill her yet.  He stayed in the house with
Mr Andrews while the woman went for a warrant, and he remarked to the ex-police Inspector, "You don't know what I have in my pocket?" to which
the witness replied, "And I'm sure I don't care."  On Monday defendant was bound over for twelve months.February 26th 1810Mr
