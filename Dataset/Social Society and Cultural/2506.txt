Time to Purchase your Bird Boxes!
Leave a reply
It doesn’t seem two minutes since we were saying goodbye to our summer visitors and breeding birds, but in a couple of months the early migrants and visitors will start to return from their wintering grounds to breed again. Our resident birds will already be looking for suitable nesting places, so now is the time to get those bird boxes up! Our friends at HandyKam provide a huge range of specialist camera boxes in all sizes from tit and sparrow to Barn Owl. They also have a great Camera Traps and feeding station cameras, bringing the wildlife and birdlife of your garden onto your TV screen! Like having your own Springwatch! For a look at their full range and to contact Mike and the team for expert advice, please click on the link on the right.
