Welsh Mustard Company Ltd.
Based in Aberaeron, West Wales, the Welsh Mustard Company is renowned for it's unique Welsh Red Mustard and Welsh Mint Sauce.
We have
created two additional luxury condiment sauces, one being our Horseradish sauce and the other our Bramley Apple Sauce.  More recently we have added to our range, a Welsh Golden Honey Mustard made with 40% honey.
We take great care in selecting the produce that goes into our mustard and sauces, the honey content gives a really distinctive yet subtle taste, which enhances the natural flavour of the sauce. Try them yourself and you'll notice the difference!
They contain no artificial preservatives, flavourings and colours and are either low in salt or contain no salt at all. For more information on our range and for a full list of product ingredients please visit our "Condiments & Sauces" web page.
If you are a restaurant or shop that would like to offer your customers a taste of Wales then have a look at our distributor list to find your local wholesale stockist.
If you can't find Welsh Mustard sauces in your local shops or you do not have a local distributor, please contact us directly and we shall endeavour to point you in the right direction or if requested place some in the post.
