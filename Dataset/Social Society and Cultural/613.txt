Discussion Forum
Contact Us with your Comments or Questions via our Discussion Forum and we will do our best to help.
The forum has an RSS feed (What
is an RSS feed?) so that you can subscribe for news of
the latest topics direct to your PC. There are plenty of free
RSS readers available and most modern web browsers allow you
to access RSS feeds ie. the Live Bookmarks feature on FireFox,
which will ask you if you want to subscribe when you visit
an RSS feed page. RSS links usually appear with this symbol
which will take you to our Forum feed. Click the link to view
the feed or drag it to your RSS reader.
You can see this RSS feed on the right, displayed in our free downloadable Widget (Win & Mac) which you can use if you don't already have an RSS reader program installed. The widget also provides
feeds with content from the What's New page
so that you can really keep up-to-date with changes on the site, and it also offers a feed from the Rootsweb mailing list ENG-YKS-CRAVEN.
Read our introduction to RSS
feeds and how to access them and feel free to join in
and leave your comments or questions on the Forum, where you
may well find someone with just the information you are looking
for.
What you will find here: We offer an extensive range
of information of interest to local and family historians, plus lots of links to other relevant sites too.
Information is divided into groups under the local township names for easy navigation. Just select the Village that interests you from the navigation buttons and see what is available.
The site is based on the historic ecclesiastical Parish of Kirkby in Malhamdale, but we also have some information on other nearby townships that fit socially and geographically within the area (Coniston Cold, Eshton, Winterburn and Bordley).
Don't forget to look at the Malhamdale page for more general information about the area.
The dedicated Malhamdale Local History Group section contains an interesting variety of projects for you to look at, plus full information about the group's activities.
Quick Search will rapidly find references to family names or places, with advanced search options available on the main Search page, however it doesn't search our Malhamdale People Finder database or the Forum, so these need to be searched separately.
New pages and more information are being added frequently, so remember to check the What's New page or subscribe to our RSS feed.
If you have any queries or comments visit our Forum and leave us a message.
Wanted New material
We are always interested in more Memories, Photographs, Maps, Deeds, Documents, Family Trees and other items relating to the area.
Don't worry, you don't have to create the actual
web pages, the webmaster will sort out your text and illustrations
into a web article, so contact our Webmaster
to discuss your ideas. We also need more volunteers to transcribe
material to go on the website. If you feel you can help please
get in touch.
