the market place.
Our main Sunday services are at 10.45am (with a Junior Church), and at 6pm. More
information on these,and other services are on our Regular Services page.
We also have many weekday activities. Members of these groups have contributed to this web-site, and their

behind the church). There is a lift to the one upstairs room.
The aims of Elvet Church, and the way it aims to meet these are given on a separate
page.
