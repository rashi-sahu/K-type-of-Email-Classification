Multi-racial league kicks off
The first match will be played at Morriston Football Club
Footballing talent among Swansea's ethnic communities is being showcased in a brand- new league kicking off this weekend.
The Zebra League is launched at Morriston Football League on Sunday.
It consists of several strong senior teams from different races and cultures living in Swansea, Neath and Port Talbot.
The league is the brainchild of Hamid Hicham of the Swansea Bay Race Equality Council.
Not all the teams could get into the normal Saturday and Sunday League, so we formed our own

"I've played football for many years and wanted to find out how interested the Asian guys and those from other communities were in regular training," said Mr Hicham.
"We ended up forming one team, the Swansea All Stars, which was very successful.

"Before long other people were asking us for information about how to set up their own teams."
Eventually teams from Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities from the Swansea, Neath and Port Talbot areas also got involved.
"Not all the teams could get into the normal Saturday and Sunday League, so we formed our own," said Mr
Hicham, who says the league is still open to other people who want to join.
"Any community that wants to put a team in the Zebra League can call us for information and we'll even help them apply for funding," said Mr Hicham.
The league has been set up with the support of Swansea Council.
An inaugural match between a team made up of all the different teams in the Zebra League and Afan lido FC will kick off on Sunday at 1400BST.
To find out about your nearest Zebra League Team or for advice on
setting up your own team, call Hamid Hicham on (01792) 457035.
