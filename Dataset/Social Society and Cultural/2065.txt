Social Work
To become a social worker, you will need an Honours degree in Social Work. There are access courses for mature students, trainee schemes and employment based routes to gaining the qualification.
Social workers form partnerships with people: helping them to assess and interpret the problems they face, and supporting them in finding solutions. They have to know how the law works and be fully up to speed
with the social welfare system. They will liaise regularly with other professionals – teachers, doctors, nurses, police, lawyers – acting on behalf of the people they are working with.
