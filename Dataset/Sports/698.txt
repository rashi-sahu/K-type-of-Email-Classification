Have your say
THE full route of the Wigan leg of the Olympic torch relay has been announced today.
It will arrive in the borough on the afternoon of Thursday. May 31 as part of its tour around the country before the Olympic Games in July – and we will be putting on a show to welcome it. The torch will begin its journey through the town in Lowton before carrying on through Abram, Wigan town centre, Ince and finally through Hindley. Leader of Wigan Council Lord Peter Smith said: “We are all tremendously proud to welcome the torch. “The borough has a rich sporting heritage and we’ll all be making the most of the time when the eyes of the world are on us.” Wigan’s Olympic athlete Jenny Meadows attended the announcement and spoke of her pride that the torch is coming to her home town. A day of entertainment is planned to welcome the torch in the town centre.
The Anvil Street Drummers will be providing the music and there will be art workshops and bike demonstrations as the town fully grasps the Olympic fever.
Ms Meadows added: “It’s absolutely fantastic that the Olympics is happening in our home nation but to bring a piece of history to our home town is really special.” The torch convoy will be nearly a fortnight into its journey across the UK when it arrives in Lowton to start its journey across the borough. A dozen vehicles will then make their way through Wigan Borough, passing through the town centre then out towards Ince and Hindley. For most of the route, the torch will be carried as a relay by a series of runners, and it is expected to be in Wigan for around three hours.THE ROUTE ...
A dozen vehicles will make their way along the B5207 through Lowton, into Golborne and then into Abram along the A573. The torch will progress into Platt Bridge and Lower Ince before a warm welcome in the town centre.For the majority of its journey in Wigan, it will be carried by selected torch bearers but for some it will be inside a vehicle. It will enter the town centre via Wallgate before travelling down Library Street, past the Town Hall, and then continuing on its journey through Scholes along the A577 past Hindley Town Hall and up Market Street.The torch will leave the borough around 5.30pm, for Westhoughton.SEE THE WIGAN EVENING POST (MONDAY) FOR MORE ...
