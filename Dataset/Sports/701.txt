WELCOME TO FOX-PITT EVENTING
I hope that you enjoy my website and find it both useful and interesting.   It will give you an insight into our competition schedule and everyday life at Wood Lane Stables.  It will also introduce you to all the horses, staff, owners and sponsors.
For more detailed information, exclusive news, pictures and videos I would recommend you join the Fox-Pitt Eventing Club.  To find out more or to sign up just click here.
We update the news and results as frequently as we can and I apologise in advance if we get a little behind at the busiest times of the season.
