I've seen so many posts on FaceBook in which people insist on spelling 'Paralympics' as 'Paraolympics'...or even 'Parolympics' (a kind of bastardisation of the two mis-spellings) and its really grating on me. Almost as much as misused apostrophes!AIBU? Should I just get over myself?

YANBU.Bad spelling drives me bonkers. I am not a perfect speller by all means but I do have a bit of a thing about it. If I put something on FB and I have a mispelled word, I delete the whole post and type it again.

Agreed. And entirely off subject, people saying 'marshmellow' and pronouncing 'medicine' as 'medsen' is pissing me off too.

'Definately' instead of 'definitely' and 'loose' instead of 'lose' (as in losing weight) really irk me too. Am glad I'm not alone lol!

YANBU. It's not even like the word is said 'paraolympics', just spell it like you say it people!Like Mrsjay, I'm also getting wound up by people constantly trying to find offence by asking why the two events aren't being held together. It just diminishes what the Paralympics is and how it originated.

It just diminishes what the Paralympics is and how it originated.I think some people are wanting to be so equal in everything that comments like they should be able to.. does cheapen what the PARALYMPICS is all about

the suggestion for the Paralympics to be merged comes from International Paralympic Committee President Sir Philip Craven.
