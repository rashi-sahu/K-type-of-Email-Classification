Welcome to Big Dance 2012 from Tamara Rojo
"I am proud to be an International Ambassador for Big Dance.
It is very appropriate that Big Dance has been chosen to represent the UK as an enduring legacy of the London 2012 Festival handed over to Rio for their Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2016.
Big Dance is so much more than a festival:It is a campaign, a powerful educator, enabling communities everywhere to share in the joy of making dance.
So let's all join in and make Big Dance 2012 great."
Tamara Rojo
