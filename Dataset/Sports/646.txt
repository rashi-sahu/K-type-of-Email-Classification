“The spotlight will be on Sunderland and the world will get a glimpse of some of the city’s finest landmarks, including our fabulous coastline, the Sunderland Aquatic Centre and Penshaw Monument.”Residents can find out exactly where the flame will be, by visiting the London 2012 Olympic Torch Relay website: www.london2012.com/olympictorchrelay.
