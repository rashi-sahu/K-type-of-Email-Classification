2017
SEASONAL
UPDATE: February 2017
The UK experienced yet another weird month, weather-wise, during
January – periods of unseasonably mild weather punctuated by very cold
conditions. A mild New Year’s Day was followed by a week-long cold
spell, with temperatures in rural Oxfordshire dipping to a chilly -8C
(18F). Milder, wetter weather swept through the week after that, with a
positively balmy (for January) 12C (54F) recorded in the south-east of
England during the second week. At times, the dichotomy in temperature
across the country was stark. On the 20th, for example, the country woke
up to 8C (46F) in Lerwick and -6C (21F) in south Farnborough. It was
generally milder in the north than the south throughout the month, and
the northern half of the UK on average had the sunnier skies as well.
There was some snow around the middle of the month, even here in
Southampton, but it was short-lived. Towards the end of the month, the
UK was plagued by dense fog that caused havoc on our roads and cancelled
flights. A final couple of days of icy weather came in the penultimate
week when a change in air direction brought cold air from the continent
and saw daytime temperatures drop to “highs” of 0C (32F) in some parts
of the Midlands, with the wind chill making it feel like -5C (23F). It
lasted only a couple of days, however, and soon mild conditions
returned.
If you want to get out and about this month, as usual, the
Wildlife Trusts
have a series of nature-themed events up and down the country, as do the
RSPB. If you feel like being proactive this month and live near the
coast, Surfers Against Sewage are looking for people to organise cleans
of their local beaches – details
here.
Alternatively, if your plans only include a walk in your local woods or
park, let’s take a look at what you might expect to see this month.
Mammals:
February is a busy time for many of our mammals. Red foxes are
coming to the end of their breeding season now, so the calling starts to
die down and long-range movements become less frequent. Many vixens will
now be pregnant and, towards the end of the month, they will start
looking for an earth (den) in which to give birth to their cubs. So, if
you have any holes under your shed or outbuilding that you don’t want a
fox potentially using as a nursery, now is the time to block the
entrance. Check out my Deterring Foxes
article for further information. Badgers are also starting to become
more active, and you may have noticed mating behaviour, in the form of
gangs of squirrels racing madly through the trees, in the squirrels in
your garden or local park. Brown hares can be seen boxing this month;
the lack of vegetation makes it easier to spot them. Similarly, low
vegetation during the winter makes it easier to spot many species that
often go about unnoticed, such as mice and voles or even stoats and
weasels. Indeed, stoats are very active in February as males are out
securing territories and looking for potential mates, while females are
looking for potential den sites and checking out local food supplies.
This winter is unlikely to have benefitted our hibernating mammals –
continual fluctuation between cold and mild spells can upset their
arousal rhythm and lead to them burning off all their fat reserves
before winter is over. In the event that February is cold, hedgehogs,
bats and dormice are likely to continue to remain in hibernation. Most
of our small mammals, by contrast, are always active and continue to be
so, even under blankets of snow, continuing their day-to-day chores in
this subnivean zone. Moles are also very active now, and they start to
extend their tunnel systems and spend time nearer the surface, so you
might notice molehills cropping up this month.
Birds: February is often a rewarding month to watch
the birds in your garden, particularly if you put food out for them.
Species that often stay away from gardens and bird feeders can be
tempted in if it gets very cold and natural food becomes scarce –
blackcaps, fieldfares, redwings and bullfinches can all turn up in
gardens at this time of year. There seem to be a considerable number of
redwings around at the moment, and there were large flocks feeding in
Bedfordshire at the end of last month. Our birds of prey are also still
very active, and we have some hen harriers overwintering on the New
Forest. Barn owls can be seen hunting during the daytime, particularly
where there is snow on the ground, and tawny owls are pair-bonding in
preparation for breeding. Tawny owl calling and fighting is often very
apparent during this month and you’re pretty much guaranteed to hear it
on any nocturnal walk in a woodland or park.
Our lakes, reservoirs and estuaries play host to a wide range of
waterfowl, including various ducks, geese and herons. Estuaries and
marshes are often a draw for birds of prey such as marsh harriers, hen
harriers, short-eared owls, peregrines and even merlins as they target
the smaller bird species overwintering there. There are still a few
great grey shrikes around, as well as large flocks of winter thrushes
and finches, and some meadow pipits and skylarks. Indeed, if you’re out
for a winter walk in the woods, keep an ear out for the ‘chitterings’ of
the striking orangey-red crossbills as they move en masse between fir
trees. While you’re among the pine trees, keep an eye out for the bright
yellow siskins and the orangey-yellow hawfinch, Britain’s largest finch
species. During your walk, scan any flocks of chaffinches for the odd
brambling along for the ride. Snow buntings often travel in large groups
during February, with their soft whistling calls heard along the north
and eastern coasts. Firecrests and goldcrests are also about at this
time of year, and these tiny restless birds can really add a spark to a
cold winter walk.
Reptiles
and Amphibians: People are often surprised to come across
reptiles during February, but it is a better month for ‘herping’ than
you might think. As the sun’s rays offer more warmth, snakes and lizards
can be found out basking in sunny spots, even when the air temperature
is in single figures. Owing to the cold, they tend to be reluctant to
move even when disturbed, which can allow for some great views. If the
mild start to February continues, many of our reptiles and amphibians
will be tempted out of torpor. If February is cold, toads and newts are
likely to be holed up somewhere out of the winter weather, while many
areas will start seeing their first frogspawn of the year. Frogs mate
early and it is not unusual to find frogspawn in February, some ponds
here in the New Forest already have some and I've seen a few Facebook
posts suggesting some folk have it in the garden ponds too, although
much of it will be killed off by frost.
Invertebrates: Normally for a February update I’d be
saying how insects and spiders are now starting to resume activity as
the weather warms up but, certainly here in the south, some species are
active already. At the end of last month I spotted a couple of bees on
the wing and many of the spiders in and around our conservatory have
resumed normal service, owing to the mild conditions. Of course,
activity in February it is not necessarily unexpected for all
invertebrate species. Those butterflies that over-winter as adults –
such as small tortoiseshell, peacock and brimstone – are often seen
among the hedgerows this month searching for the early flowers. Queen
bumblebees have the ability to, metaphorically speaking, take their
wings out of gear and fire their large flight muscles to generate heat
that allows them to warm up sufficiently to resume activity. Wood ants
set about rebuilding their winter-ravaged nest this month, and seething
tangles of black ant bodies can be found covering the nests as they join
together in a bid to absorb as much of the sun’s warmth as possible.
Plants and Fungi: As we get towards the end of
February and the weather starts to warm further, the longer days and
milder temperatures result in a veritable explosion of plant life. There
are already snowdrops in abundance down here in Hampshire, and this
month should also see flowering alder, goat willow, lungwort, dog’s
mercury, primroses, crocuses and yew. Sweet violet and three-cornered
garlic also make early appearances in February. Poisonous sulphur tuft
fungi can be found sprouting from dead wood (old tree stumps and fallen
branches) during this month, and some similarly inedible polypore and
twiglet fungi can also be found. For the fungi forager, February
woodland can yield jelly ear, oyster mushrooms, velvet shank and a few
wood blewit.

Discovery of the Month: New software can automatically identify
individual sharks by their fins
A
big part of any species conservation effort is to understand how many
animals you have, where they hang out, and how far they travel. In order
to collect some of these data, it helps to be able to uniquely identify
individuals. Typically, this is done by marking animals - using unique
fur/skin patterns or permanent injuries, or attaching tags or colour
paint. When it comes to sharks, particularly big powerful ones, the
problem is complicated because we often have to catch and restrain them
while we attach a tag to their dorsal fin. This is no small task; it’s
labour intensive and potentially dangerous for both the researchers and
the sharks.
We’ve known for a long time that the nicks and scratches that sharks
pick up on their dorsal fins as they grow can be indicative of the
individual. This means that, with a good enough view of the fin in, say,
a photograph, you can identify the individual shark. A problem with this
technique, however, is that someone has to sit and sort through photos
trying to match the fin with one on file , and an element of human error
easily creeps in, particularly if old wounds start to heal or new ones
are picked up. Last year, University of Bristol computer scientists Ben
Hughes and Tilo Burghardt developed a computer model that can
automatically run a dorsal fin analysis and identify the fin’s owner,
potentially quicker and more reliably than doing it by eye. (Image:

Figure 10 from the paper, published under Creative

identification examples using the algorithm. Image on the left are
queries and right ones are predicted individuals based on photo
database. Coloured lines indicate start and end of the ten sections
contributing most evidence for the matched individual.)
In a paper submitted to the International Journal of Computer
Vision, Hughes and Burghardt described the mathematics and
programming behind their identification system. I’m not going to pretend
I’m familiar enough with computational modelling to explain exactly what
this computer model does, but in essence the computer vision photo
system scans a photo of a shark’s fin, identifies all the contours, and
compares it to a database of contour values from the 240 photos that
were used to ‘train’ the system. As the system uses all the contours of
the fin, rather than just the basic superficial appearance, and it is
sensitive enough to detect small dents and nicks, even if the fin
sustains damage later on, the software may still be able to correctly
identify it. Based on the photos they used in the training, the software
was able to identify individuals with at least 82% accuracy, and the
hope is that this can be further improved by introducing more photos.
Given that many shark species can be baited and will readily swim with
their dorsal fin breaking the surface when approaching the bait, it is a
relatively straightforward process to get a high quality photo of the
dorsal fin. This system then offers great potential to provide
much-needed data on how many sharks are in an area and help build a
picture of their movements. It may also be applicable to citizen science
projects working with sharks, further expanding its scope.

Profile
of the Month: Georgia French, SharkStuff
Tell us a little about yourself
I’m the Founder and Chairperson of SharkStuff, a legally
constituted small charity based in Poole, Dorset. I’m also a full-time
PhD candidate studying great white sharks. I moved to Dorset three years
ago after living in the Seychelles for four years, where I spent three
and a half years working for the Marine Conservation Society, Seychelles
as Project Coordinator. I managed projects on coastal development,
turtles, and sharks, and was responsible for shark tagging and designing
protected areas. Previous to working in the Seychelles, I earned a
degree in Zoology from Cardiff University and a Masters in Wildlife
Management and Conservation from the University of Reading. I love
surfing, skateboarding, yoga, rock climbing and the menagerie that I
share with my partner Chris – currently at two dogs, one cat and a
parrot!
How did SharkStuff come about?
SharkStuff began as a blog about my PhD work, which was then
joined by a Facebook page. I wanted to share my work and passion for
sharks, and was sick of seeing them misrepresented in the general media.
I was keen to promote our local species and the more I learned about the
sharks right here in Dorset, the more I realised that the majority of my
community don’t realise that they are here, or that many of them are
threatened with extinction. Before SharkStuff, there were no
shark-focussed organisations working on the ground in Dorset. To achieve
my goals of engaging the public with their local sharks, and learning
more about the sharks to help understand and protect them, I needed to
form a consolidated organisation that could operate effectively, and win
funds that would make the work possible. That’s when I knew that I
wanted SharkStuff to become a charity, and Chris and I made it
happen.
Why the UK? Your fascination was triggered in the Seychelles
and there are parts of the world with bigger reputations as shark
hot-spots than here.
All of my previous shark work had been conducted abroad, and when I
moved back to the UK, it really hit home that we have many incredible
species here too that are also in dire need of assistance.
What do you like most about the work you do?
I
love seeing the excitement, fascination, and surprise on people’s faces
when they find out that we have sharks here, and seeing them get
enthused is just magic. I feel very grateful that in Dorset, the other
local marine organisations have been very collaborative and supportive,
and it’s fantastic to be able to work with them and provide each other
with data and opportunities. I’m so excited by all the upcoming projects
and events that we are going to be running this year, and the feeling
that we are making a tangible difference for sharks is incredible.
Obviously getting to see and be close to sharks themselves is also
breath-taking for me!
What do you find the most frustrating aspect of your work?
One of the things that I find most frustrating is feeling like I don’t
have time to do everything that I would like to. I’m very ambitious and
have big plans for SharkStuff, but I have to be patient and
finish my PhD before I can dedicate myself entirely to it. I regularly
get very frustrated with the media when they consistently over
sensationalise shark/human interactions and deliberately portray sharks
in a very negative light in order to boost viewership. Studies have
shown that the public perception of sharks significantly affects shark
conservation, and that negative media directly influences that
perception. Considering that a quarter of chondrichthyans (sharks, rays
and chimaeras) are threatened with extinction, that kind of
irresponsibility is inexcusable. (Image: A
Tope shark, Galeorhinus galeus, caught as part of a shark
survey conducted off the Dorset coast by SharkStuff, Dorset Wildlife
Trust and Swanage Sea Fishing.)
If you had to choose one thing you’ve learned about your
subject during the course of your research that stands out as
particularly fascinating/valuable/weird, what would it be?
I would have to say that it consistently surprises me that some things
that are accepted as fact aren’t actually true. Facts about white sharks
that date back decades and are just accepted as true in the scientific
community, are actually more complex than previously thought. I have
also been fascinated to learn that not every shark is the same, and they
very much do their own thing – there are vast differences in shark
behaviour, migration, foraging ecology etc. based on size, sex and
individual differences, and this variation needs to be recognised and
included in conservation management plans.
How can people find out more?
You can find out more about SharkStuff on our
blog (very
soon to be upgraded to a full website), and our
Facebook page.
Shark and ray egg case hunters at Hengistbury
Head last month. The hunt was organised by SharkStuff and the volunteers found 89
egg cases from at least four different species.

==========================================================================================================================
Okay, for those of you that are new to the site, let's take it from
the top!
What is Wildlife Online?
Essentially, WLOL is an educational website
about British wildlife. The site contains profiles of various British
animal species, with new articles in preparation all the time. The site
also has articles looking at wildlife-related subjects, including
hunting and animal emotions. This site is purely a hobby of mine; it
does not generate any money or contain any advertising and, for the time
being at least, I am happy
for it to stay that way.
What does Wildlife Online aim to achieve?
The ultimate goal of the
website is to be useful. My intention has always been to provide
un-biased, accurate information that’s accessible to anyone with an
Internet connection. Increasingly people are coming into contact with
their local wildlife and whether such interactions are positive or
negative, they generally inspire a desire to learn more about the
species. Moreover, there are still a great many misconceptions
surrounding our wildlife (fox behaviour springs immediately to mind) and
these are brought up time and time again during discussions in the
media. Each article aims to provide a reasonably comprehensive overview
of the species in question by drawing on information from the media,
books, TV programmes and the scientific literature. I feel that this
combination of sources, along with my own observations and those of my
friends/colleagues/readers provides a unique online resource of British
wildlife information. My hope is that the information provided here will
go some way to changing people's perceptions of the creatures with which
they share their parks and gardens.
Why create a website when there are books and TV programmes about
your subjects?
Books can be a fantastic resource and I can't imagine being
without my library. Not all libraries are, however, equally well
stocked, and not everyone has the funds to splash out on what are often
very expensive wildlife books (especially those written by scientists).
More importantly, much of the scientific research never makes it out of
the journals into books and TV shows. Similarly, many of the early books
-- which contain some of the pioneering work on the species -- are now
long out of print and can be difficult or expensive to track down. Books
have the 'luxury' of being able to devote their entire contents to a
particular species, covering all aspects of its life history.
Television, by contrast, is a much more limited and variable medium: the programme editor(s) has to create a show that is likely to hold the
viewers' attention and appeal to a very wide audience. The result is
that, although some reach this compromise very well, many documentaries focus heavily on the 'wow factor'
(multitudinous slow motion shots of Great whites leaping out of the
water in pursuit of seals, for example) and this often comes at the
inevitable expense of the information about the animal. Finally, both
books and TV programmes go out of date quite quickly; new research is
being conducted all the time. Consequently, a website is an ideal and
dynamic intermediate
- it offers the opportunity to provide a decent amount of information
about the subject that can be updated at the metaphorical drop-of-a-hat
as any new research is published.
Why include so much information?
I honestly believe that if a job is
worth doing, it's worth doing well. There are hundreds of websites with
brief species profiles and if that's all WLOL offered there would be
little point to it. I understand and appreciate that some people find
being confronted with large volumes of text very daunting while others are of
the 'too long; didn't read' mind-set and will thus be turned off by the
amount of text facing them. I have tried to remedy this as far as
possible via two avenues: there is a Speed Read section with a brief profile of each
species featured in a main article; and each article has been 'virtually
split', with the aid of hyperlinks, into sections that allow people to
easily jump to the information they're looking for. Ultimately, I want to provide as
much information as is feasible in order to provide the reader with the
clearest appraisal of each species or topic; I hope that most readers approve of
this approach.
Why haven't you included a complete bibliography?
My intention with
WLOL is to provide the information in an accessible format, which means
that anyone should be able to read an article and understand the
information in it. Consequently, I didn't want to format it as a
scientific paper because the current format allows for a much more
informal approach and writing style which, I hope, will appeal to a
wider audience. Most people should find enough information in the
article (I typically provide the name or one or more of the authors and
the journal and year) to track down the original scientific paper. When
I take information from books, I always give the name of the author(s)
and the full title of the book for easy reference. I am also happy to
provide full details of any of the references upon request.
Are you really qualified to do this?
I'm certainly not an expert on
any of the subjects presented on this site. The articles stem from my
varied interests in natural history and biological sciences. In terms of
qualifications, I trained as a scientist (studying natural sciences at
degree and postgraduate level) and all I really do is interpret
information, blend it with associated research and personal observation,
and present it in what I hope is an accessible format. Unless
specifically stated, I do not claim any of the information on this site
to be my own research. I have built relationships with some of the many
diligent researchers who have
produced the data that I use, and I am happy either to recommend an
expert or provide my own opinions on a subject.
As a final note, I want to make a quick reference to the quality of
the material on the site. The great French philosopher and
mathematician, Rene Descartes, once said: "If you would be a real seeker
of truth, you first must be willing to doubt as far as possible all
things." This is very sage advice, especially when it comes to believing
what you read on the Internet. Most Internet sites (indeed, some books and TV
shows too), including this one, have no form of peer-review (i.e. nobody
with experience of the topic checks the site for accuracy); consequently
pretty much anyone can have their own little corner of cyberspace and
information can make it onto websites that is either misguided, or
downright false! When creating material for this site I take every care
to ensure that the information I present is accurate. Invariably errors
will creep in; typos are almost inevitable (although each article goes
through several levels of proof reading before it appears online) and
research is always underway on the species featured here, so the data
can go out of date almost overnight. Each page has regular (ish!)
reviews, however, during which I update the information, adding details of new
findings and taking out that which is now thought highly unlikely. You
can see most of the books I have used in the preparation of this site on
the Recommended Reading page and I have provided links to some of the
most interesting sites I came across during my research – these can be
found under the appropriate sub-heading on the Links page.
Anyway, I digress.... I hope you enjoy looking around the site and I
hope equally that you get something worthwhile out of it. Any comments,
suggestions or (constructive) criticisms are welcome via e-mail -
appropriate addresses can be found on the Contact page.
