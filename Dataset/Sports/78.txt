Welcome to the Forest Ramblers web site
About us
The
Forest Ramblers are a London
walking club founded in 1884. We are generally believed to be the oldest
rambling club still in existence in the UK*; on November 30th 2014
we celebrated the 130th anniversary of the club’s formation.
Our
club’s original purpose was to give active support to the City of London Corporation in
their endeavours to conserve Epping Forest,
which they had acquired a few years earlier and which was formally dedicated
as a public amenity by Queen Victoria
on May 6th 1882.
The Forest Ramblers’ activities soon spread to a much wider area, however,
and in the early days included visits to such distant destinations as Matlock
and even Paris. Nowadays all our walks are in Greater London and the Home
Counties.
The
club’s object, according to our constitution, is “to organise and carry out
short rambles to places tending to healthful and instructive recreation and
antiquarian interest”. We encourage our leaders to follow this principle
whenever possible.
The
Forest Ramblers’ walks have always taken place in mid-week. This arrangement
was designed in the nineteenth century to suit retail traders, who enjoyed an
early closing day on Wednesday or Thursday. In modern times it benefits
people who for any reason at all find rambling in mid-week more convenient
than at weekends. Wednesday walks ceased in fairly early times and nowadays
we walk only on Thursdays.
We
are affiliated to the Inner London Area of the Ramblers.
Our
walks start fairly late in the morning, to allow full use of the London
Freedom Pass and the Senior Railcard.

history.

About our rambles
Area covered:
We walk in London and
surrounding counties
Frequency:
Our rambles take place on
all second. fourth and fifth Thursdays except in December (second only)
Travel:
All our walks are based on
rail travel (National Rail or TfL)
Meeting place:
We meet at the station
where the ramble begins (not the London departure station), so that you can
make your own travel arrangements if you wish
Starting time:
Our walks start in late
morning and are nearly always timed so that rail travellers do not have to
leave London before 10.30 a.m.
Distance:
Rambles are generally 6 to
7 miles, but may be slightly shorter when visits to places of interest are
included
Speed:
Our average walking speed
is about 2 miles an hour (leisurely to moderate)

We enjoy a convivial pub
lunch, within 2 miles of the start if possible
