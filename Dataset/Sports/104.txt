The Jack Uttley Photo Library
Here is a selection
from Jack Uttley's
collection of old photographs. The
photographs were taken
around the pennine towns of Hebden Bridge,
Mytholmroyd and
Heptonstall and date from about 1860 to the present.
The pictures
are from scans of
glass plates, old postcards, old prints and 35mm film.
Most of the photographs dated after 1950 were taken by my father. (Jack Uttley).
Some recent pictures are included to show
