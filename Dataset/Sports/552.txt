About Me Natasha Baker MBE
5 time Paralympic Equestrian Champion and 5 time European ChampionHometown: Uxbridge, Middlesex
At the 2016 Rio Paralympic Games Natasha won a remarkable three Gold medals, one in each of the events she competed in; Individual, Freestyle and Team Gold! At London 2012 Natasha claimed Britain’s first equestrian gold medal of the Games, achieving a Paralympic record (76.857%) for her Grade II class in winning the Championship Test.
Natasha delivered again two days later in front of an impassioned home crowd, winning her second gold of London 2012. Her victory in the Freestyle event set yet another Paralympic record (82.800%) and she achieved her third personal best. As a result of her achievements at London 2012, Natasha became one of only 25 British Paralympians to be awarded an MBE by the Queen. Natasha suffers from Transverse Myelitis, a condition that has left her with permanent nerve damage and severe weakness in her legs since contracting a virus at 14 months old. Natasha is unable to use her legs whilst riding, instructing her horses entirely through verbal commands and seat movements.
Aged 9, Natasha’s physio recommended that she applied to the local RDA. It was evident Natasha had a strong passion for the sport and after watching the Paralympics in Sydney 2000, she set herself the goal of one day becoming a Paralympic Champion.
In 2002, Natasha was selected for the World Class Programme and by 2005 had a string of National and International titles to her name including the Overall U21 International Champion. One of the most defining moments of her career came in 2009, when she discovered her mount Cabral at the yard of Christian Landolt. Together, Natasha and Cabral developed a unique bond, leading to a succession of international honours. Natasha works tirelessly to inspire the next generation of Paralympic athletes and change the perception towards those with disabilities.

There is no better feeling than walking out into the arena and performing in front of a passionate crowd. The support at London 2012 was the most incredible feeling, I want to bottle that up and keep it forever.
Team Baker
Having grown up on the family farm Natasha has always been surrounded by horses. She has had the continual support of her friends and family, affectionately known as “Team Baker”.
Lorraine Baker
Lorraine (mum) is Natasha’s full time International groom. Lorraine goes with Natasha to all of her competitions and training, looking after the horses and getting them ready for their competitions.
Phil Baker
Phil (Dad) also works full time at the yard whilst being replied upon to drive the horsebox, do the cooking and capture the photography.
Jess Kinge
Jess is Natasha’s groom and is in charge of the yard when Natasha is away. Jess comes to competitions to help and also competes her own horse. Jess will eventually become Natasha’s international groom when Lorraine retires.
Lisa Hopkins
Lisa has been training Natasha since 2013 and visits Natasha’s yard to teach her twice a week. Lisa also travels to Natasha’s competitions both Nationally and Internationally to train and warm-up her horses. She has represented Great Britain Internationally at Grand Prix.
Dorothy Alder
Dorothy has always been incredibly supportive of Natasha's riding since she started at the RDA. Without the support of her Nan and Grandad (who has now sadly passed away) Natasha would not be the successful rider she has become.
Christian Landolt
Christian and Natasha first met in 2009 when she visited his yard on the lookout for a new horse. They have since become great friends and Christian has provided Natasha with a huge amount of support throughout her career so far. Christian owns Cabral, Sookie St James and Fireball.

At the age of 10 I was inspired by the Sydney 2000 Paralympics. I have tremendous support from my followers and it would be a dream come true if I could inspire others to fulfill their dreams and aspirations.
