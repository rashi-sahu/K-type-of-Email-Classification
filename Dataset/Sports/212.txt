Welcome
On the second Saturday in September, every year since 1844, Usk Farmers’ Club have held the Usk Show to celebrate the very best of Monmouthshire farming and rural life.  Now one of the biggest One-Day Agricultural Shows in the whole of the UK, its popularity is second-to-none.
At the 100 acre Usk Showground near the village of Gwernesney just outside Usk (Sat Nav: NP15 1DD), the Show comprises 11 different Sections each holding their own competitions on the day.  Usk Farmers Club Members bring their Cattle, Sheep and Pigs to compete in the Agricultural Livestock Section.  There is a thriving Horse Show and Show Jumping Competitions, as well as Goats, Poultry, Rabbits, Horticulture, Homecrafts, a Companion Dog Show, Steam Corner and Vintage Tractors.
In our Main Ring and Countryside Ring we have attractions and demonstrations taking place throughout the day.  For 2016, we welcome The Kangaroo Kids with their Quad-Bike Stunt Show to our afternoon programme in the Main Ring.
Over 300 traders join us each year outdoors and in our Food Hall, Craft Marquee or Shopping Mall.
And you can come and enjoy it all!
We have something for everyone and we can’t wait to welcome you...
