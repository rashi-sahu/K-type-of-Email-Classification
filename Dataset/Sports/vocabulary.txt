you
get
what
you

This
especially
true
for
websites

Recently
the
famous
MLM
company
Vemma
was
knocked
out
the
industry
the
but
was
deemed
illegal
pyramid
but
many
people
get
confused
aren‚Äôt
all
MLM
companies
some
way
shape
form
pyramid
What
makes
MLM
companies
like
Vemma
any
different
than
say
you
see
what

not

which
illegal
that
the
end
the
day
the
company

revenue
providing
true

than
considered

For
example
company
like
AdvoCare
actually
sells
their
supplements
people
even
when
people
invest
front
become
Advisor
they
can
get
paid
they
are
purchasing
worth
products
there

When
the
company
takes
turn
the
dark
side
when
they
sell
the
business
opportunity
only
and
real
tangible
product
service
exchanged
the
end
rather
false
promise
business
opportunity
which
most
people
the
company
reaps
revenue
from
duping
with
model
that
counts
people
duping
more
therefore
the
company
not
providing
any
value
customers
This
why
AdvoCare
stresses
the
importance
the
fact
that
they
are
product
oriented
company
and
they
are
big
supporting
and
promoting
their
products
through

Shame
Vemma
and
countless
other

where
they
got
too
greedy
for
their

instead
focusing

development
like
they
should
such
Tesla‚Äôs
Elon

his

should
focus
more
the

rather
than
about

all
things
naturally

for

that

Vemma
really
had
the
intentions
duping
people
but
one
thing
for
certain
has
stirred
small
uproar
the
MLM
community
where
people
are
questioning
the
legitimacy
their
own
MLM
Its
fine
does
the

the
