Charter consultation
Sylva Foundation is supporting the
2017 Charter for Trees, Woods and People, by capturing the stories of woodland owners and custodians. We want to ensure
that the Charter speaks for them, and recognises their vital role as
custodians of the nation’s woodland heritage.
If you are a woodland owner or custodian please take part. The simple online consultation will take only a few minutes to complete. Your woodland will be registered by county in the 2017 Charter.
