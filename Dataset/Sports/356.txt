Solidarity with Carpenters – UCL students sit in
Solidarity with Carpenters – UCL students sit in
UCL has plans to build a new campus in Stratford – on top of 318 families’ homes.
Stratford already has one of London’s highest waiting lists for a council house – with an average of ten years for a two bedroom flat.
UCL is only fuelling this already serious housing crisis, not to mention destroying an entire community and potentially setting an example for other institutions to do the same.
Come to UCL’s Wilkins Garden Room to find out more

UCL Stratford: Bulldozing a Community?
31 Oct 2012 – 18:00 – 20:00
Public event · By UCL Union
On the 24th of October, Newham Council approved UCL’s proposal to build a new campus on the Carpenter’s Estate, despite opposition from residents, leading UCL academics, and UCLU. If UCL doesn’t pull out now or radically revise its plans, this would mean destroying hundreds of people’s homes, their community, and their history. There is still time to save the Carpenters Estate.
Is this how a university should behave? Come hear from Carpenters residents, housing experts, UCL staff and students and make up your own mind – is UCL bulldozing a community?
Food & refreshments will be provided. Invite your friends & lecturers!
AV Hill Lecture Theatre, UCL Bloomsbury Main Campus

Save Leyton Marsh – Marshroots Celebration – October 21st
Sunday 21st October – Marshroots Celebration: Reclamation of Leyton Marsh. We will be celebrating the return of Leyton Marsh to the people who have fought so hard for it!
This will be a joyous family event to also celebrate the end of the punitive injunctions ruled against the people in order for the unwanted monstrosity to be built.
We will have the Albion Kids’ Show – circus skills and a talent show for children of all ages; Art Action – artists and amateurs to join us for painting, sculpting and drawing the spirit of the marsh; and Ranters’ Corner – an open mic stage for poets, radicals and historians to air their views.
We have a Facebook Page for the day for you to like and share with others

Next CON meeting Saturday 22nd September, 3 p.m.
Saturday 22nd September, 3 p.m – 6 p.m.
LARC, 62 Fieldgate Street, London E1 1ES.  (This is a small street parallel to Whitechapel Road, and is directly behind the East London Mosque; nearest tube Whitechapel.)
WHAT NEXT FOR CON?
In the face of considerable hostility, CON ran a very successful campaign, which helped to fight against many different aspects of the Olympics and Paralympics.  In the process we drew together groups and individuals with varying interests and political perspectives, and helped put the issues on the map.
Now that the London Olympics and Paralympics are over, CON has to move forward to build on the energy and campaigning strengths generated, and to make sure the lessons we learnt are not wasted. Simply put, there are two main strands to ongoing campaigning on Olympic issues (and obviously there is overlap between them):
* Legacy, what legacy?  Here in London, we have been told that there will be substantial legacy.  Even people who believed in it before can see that the promises are already crumbling.  Some members of CON want to prioritise monitoring and campaigning around legacy issues, sometimes with local groups and sometimes with other interest groups.
* ICON – the International Counter Olympic Network.  Even though the Games have now left London, it is an ongoing concern that most of the problems that afflicted us will also affect the places that will be hosting future Winter Olympics, Summer Olympics and Paralympics, and the now being widely promoted Youth Olympics. We envisage that ICON will grow from the work that we have already done in London, and will focus on campaigning around the multinational companies who are majorly involved with the Olympics as sponsors and suppliers, doing research into the IOC and other transnational issues, and providing a focus for groups who have already been saddled with Olympics or who want to campaign against them coming.
We intend that next Saturday’s meeting will consist of brief presentations about both these strands, and we hope that we can also hear updates from any groups and individuals who would like to fill us in about ongoing campaigning they are already doing or they would like to move forward with.
