The Role of CCFG
Our
primary role is to promote the transformation of even-aged plantations
to structurally, visually and biologically diverse woodlands. We also
aim to enhance the production of high quality timber according to the principles
of continuous cover management. We are a technical and professional
organisation dedicated to developing skills and disseminating
knowledge. In addition, we contribute to policy formulation and wider
debates about sustainable forestry in Britain. CCFG is a member of
ProSilva Europe, a federation of forestry organisations committed to
advancing "close to nature" silvicultural systems.
